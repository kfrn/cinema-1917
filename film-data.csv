In it, Oxilia spins a variation on the Faust myth, embodied here by the diva Lyda Borelli. Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the ""tail coat film." Diametrically opposed to the "cinema of reality" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, "tail coat films" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the "dive" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTlhZjkyNWItOWY1NC00ZThiLWI3Y2YtYmQxZTQ0ZDdmMDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1NTE4MTc@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0005951","6.9","276","movie"

At their headquarters, in the Gila Mountains, in consultation with ""Ace High," his lieutenant, he plans depredations on the neighboring settlements. Although Hudspeth is powerful, their rule is disputed by El Salvador, a half-breed, and his following of desperadoes. Desert Pass is the scene of many conflicts between the contending bands. Rumors of the arrival of miners with gold causes El Salvador to send "Cactus" Fuller, his henchman, to levy tribute by a hold-up, which is successful. Flushed with triumph, he boasts in the "Golden Fleece" saloon of the ignominies to which he would treat Cliff Hudspeth if he ever met him. Hudspeth arrives and makes Cactus, whom he throws out of the saloon, realize that something must be done to retrieve a shattered reputation. Coming out of the saloon, Hudspeth sees Norma Wright, a milliner, standing at the door of her little store, and waves her inside, as he anticipates trouble. The shooting commences and Cactus is defeated. As Hudspeth is preparing to leave town Norma denounces him as a cold-blooded murderer. Stung almost to madness by the girl's accusation, he seizes her and gallops out of town. At his retreat he locks the stupefied girl in a room and seeks to drown the memory of her words with whiskey. The whiskey, and his awakened conscience, bring him to review his life, and, half delirious, he sees his victims pass reproachfully before him. The girl, too, becomes aware of the human side of the man and next morning she brings him around to her way of thinking and extracts a pledge that he will never willingly kill another human being. Soon after there comes from a member of the legislature offer of a pardon and restoration to citizenship if Cliff will undertake to rid Arizona of El Salvador. Hearing of Cliff's new appointment, El Salvador is wild with rage, and burns the town and drags Norma away to the mountains. Cliff Hudspeth rescues her and kills El Salvador, although mortally wounded himself. He places the girl on a horse, which bears her to safety, and passes away consoled that his last killing was in her defense.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjRlNzg5MWQtNDMwNi00MjNlLWJjMTQtZTc4ZTkwNzYxOGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYzMDY1NTg@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008036","6.6","5","movie"

The boy's life is a drab one until, in an effort to escape his sister's wrath, he runs into a graveyard where he is seized by an escaped convict, Provis, who threatens him with instant death if he does not give him food and a file with which to remove the ball and chain from his ankle. Pip does as he is bid, only to have the convict captured and brought to the blacksmith shop, when poor Pip nearly expires for fear he will be apprehended. But the grateful Provis lies to save him. The next step in the history of Pip is the arrival of Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, who is so struck by his gentility that he selects him as a companion for Estella, the adopted daughter of his client, Miss Havisham, a most secretive and peculiar woman. The companionship of the two youngsters ripens into love as they grow older, until Pip learns to his dismay that Miss Havisham has deliberately encouraged them with the purpose of breaking his heart. The young lovers are separated and Pip is made the beneficiary of a legacy which enables him to go to London, live as a gentleman and be thoroughly educated. He does not know the source of this income, but believes that Miss Havisham is secretly making amends for her cruelty. He finally discovers the whereabouts of Estella and they plight their troth. That night Pip is dashed to the depths of despair by the arrival of Provis, the convict, who reveals the fact that it is he who has been supplying Pip with money. The poor boy believes that Estella will scorn him when she learns the truth, but he has reckoned without the finer qualities of Estella who comes to his assistance and even helps the convict in his fatal effort to escape the police. Over his dead body there arises the vision of a new romance as the two young lovers pay homage to the better side of this remarkable man's character.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzFjNjY5N2EtOGNkMy00MTk4LThkN2UtOWI4MzBjMmNlNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008029","6.6","11","movie"

Lacking money and protection, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the advances of the largely all-male population, and so must acknowledge Brown publicly as her uncle in order to continue to receive food, shelter, and his protection.

Five of these men were the victims of "The Voice" (also dis-embodied) in previous chapters, the sixth was Dr. Reynolds and the seventh was Emil LaRoux.

The other members were convinced that no one would consent to being mummified alive. But LaRoux learned that he could easily dominate the will of Reynolds' wife, Irene. He told five of the members he had found his subject for the experiment. The one he didn't tell was Reynolds. A year later, deep in the heart of the African jungle on an expedition and in Reynold's absence, LaRoux made Irene his experiment victim, and left the camp with her mummified body and her infant child. In pursuit, Reynolds found LaRoux's dead body in the desert sand, with a note in his hand saying he had sent Irene's mummified body back to civilization to the five members not on the expedition and the baby son was to be the channeled means of communication with her in what LaRoux called "The Living Death". That night Reynold's was bitten by a snake and his servant cut off his hand to save his life.

Although a robber, the Black Wolf is a benefactor at heart, as is shown in his many charitable acts towards the poor and helpless. The Duke rides with the Chancellor to meet the Countess Dona Isabel, the Chancellor's daughter, and on their return trip they come upon the Black Wolf assisting a friend to escape the police. Outnumbered, the Duke's men withdraw, but a price is then placed upon the bandit's capture, "dead or alive." Declaring his love to the Countess, the Duke takes Dona Isabel in his arms, but freeing herself, she starts to run through the forest, the Duke in pursuit. He stumbles and is found by a member of the Black Wolf's band, who takes a ring from him. Isabel meets the Black Wolf, who takes her to the castle, promising to return the following night. He does call, but is discovered by the Duke, who lays his plans to capture him on his next visit. The Black Wolf takes a locket and chain from the neck of the Countess, preferring, for her sake, to be taken as a thief instead of a lover. He is sentenced to die, but Dona Isabel's promise to marry the Duke secures his pardon. According to the laws he whom the Duke pardons becomes his slave for life. Only the desire to keep secret Isabel's love for him influences the Black Wolf to accept the pardon. The Black Wolf was raised by Old Luis, a charcoal burner and a comparison of a locket and chain in his possession, with the ring taken from the Duke's finger, leads to the discovery that the Black Wolf is the rightful successor to the title now held by the Duke, and he is declared by the King to be the legal ruler and Duke. Don Phillip endeavors to hold Isabel to her promise to marry him, attempts to assassinate the Black Wolf, now the Duke del Miras, and is finally killed in a duel with his successor. The real Duke and Dona Isabel are at last united.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTU1MTgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDI4MTg5._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0006436",,,"movie"

She is betrothed to George Renoir, an artist friend of her father, who is devotedly in love with her. Marie has suddenly developed flirtatious symptoms and to warn and guard her against the trouble she is likely to create for herself and others, unless she ceases her folly, De Severac tells her the plot of his unpublished story, ""Black Orchids." Zoraida is a sorceress whose only aim in life seems to be the entanglement of men in her meshes. Sebastian De Maupin is envious of his son Ivan, who is temporarily in Zoraida's favor, and to get rid of the youthful lover the father uses his influence to have his boy sent to the front line of battle in the war then raging. Sebastian De Maupin, thinking himself now in sole possession of Zoraida's affections, introduces her to Marquis De Chantal, a rich and handsome nobleman, upon whom Zoraida turns her attentions. Enraged because Zoraida seems to have abandoned him, De Maupin arranged a dinner at which he plans to poison De Chantal and be thus rid of his rival. Zoraida changes the cups and De Maupin drinks the poisoned brew, dying instantly. Ivan now comes home from war, wounded in body, but still fired in his heart with love for Zoraida. The wretch quickly turns her affections again toward Ivan, creating jealousy in De Chantal's heart, and a duel results. Ivan inflicts what is believed to be a fatal wound upon De Maupin and goes with Zoraida to an estate De Chantal has bequeathed to her in a will he made when the count was basking in the woman's favor. De Chantal is indeed fatally wounded, but lives long enough to avenge himself upon the fickle Zoraida and her youthful lover. In the castle De Chantal he has willed to Zoraida is an air-tight vault and there the count causes the woman and her lover to be entrapped, where they must die of suffocation, while De Chantal at last expires of his wound, upon the doorsill of the living tomb of Zoraida and Ivan. When Emile De Severac has finished the narrative, his daughter, Marie, is penitent and remorseful, because she has given her sweetheart pain, and the once fickle and flirtatious girl lives now with her eyes open to the danger of her folly.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDM3MzkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTYxMjU0MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0006434",,,"movie"

She is one of the quaint girl flower-sellers on the streets of Paris, earning a few sous daily, which she is compelled to give toward the support of the family. It was while selling her wares in one of the big restaurants that she is first seen by Caoudal, the famous sculptor, who recognizes her wonderful beauty and persuades her to pose for him. The luxury of his studio awakens in her an unsuspected love for the beautiful things of life. One step leads to another, and it is not long before she becomes the most talked of and sought after model of Paris. She is content to live in this way, reveling in beauty and the admiration of her friends and Caoudal himself, until Dejoie, the poet, moved by her beauty, writes verses to her which make both himself and her still more famous, winning her away from Caoudal. The poet is too old to hold the attention of the young girl, who craves young society and admiration, so when she meets handsome young Flamant, she lightly tells Dejoie that he is ""too old" and gains the friendship of the younger man. Flamant is an engraver and finds himself hard put to it to gratify the expensive whims of Sapho, but as he is really very fond of the handsome model, he manages to forge a name and obtain money under false pretenses. His ruse is discovered, and as the gendarmes come to lead him away to prison, Sapho receives an invitation to a ball to take place that very evening. At the ball she appears as "Sapho" and there meets for the first time the student, Jean Gaussin, with whom she falls in love. It is a case of love at first sight on both sides and the two are very happy, and Sapho is learning to express the better side of her nature when Jean is shocked by accidentally learning of her past life. It is the "beginning of the end." Jean finally weds a little country girl, and Sapho, rather than return to her old life, turns Red Cross nurse and consecrates the rest of her life to that noble work.",,"tt0008535","4.6","5","movie"

Taylor","Derwent Hall Caine, Marian Swayne, Sidney Bracey, Albert Froom","Daniel Mylrea is the son of the Bishop of Man, the baron of the Isle of Man, whose temporal power is higher even than that of the Deemster, or governor. The Bishop desires Dan to become a minister, but he prefers to be a fisherman. The Deemster of Man has a son and a daughter, Mona and Ewan. Dan and Mona are in love. She consents to marry him when he can obtain her father's consent. Ewan, her brother, decides to become a clergyman, even in the face of his father's insistence that he take up business as a vocation. The Deemster opposes Dan's suit for Mona's hand because he has fallen from his high estate as the son of the Bishop by becoming a fisherman. His dislike turns to open hatred when Dan endeavors to borrow money from Ewan, whom he thought his friend, to pay off the crew of his boat. Dan had squandered his earnings of the season in drink. Ewan refuses Dan the loan, who makes him a bitter enemy by knocking him down on his taunt that spending money in drink is as bad as theft. Dan is now opposed in his love for Mona by both her father and brother. The Deemster forbids Dan to come to his house to visit her. Despite this, he sees her at night. Though this meeting is innocent in intent, the Deemster uses it to inflame the mind of Ewan against Dan, whom he supposes has dishonored his sister. Arming himself with a knife, Ewan seeks Dan and comes upon him at his cabin while he is mending his nets. They quarrel and Ewan falls backward over a cliff and is killed. Dan's crew of fishermen throw the body into the sea, hoping to hide his death, but the tide sweeps it ashore. It is discovered and suspicion of murder falls on Dan. He is arrested by the Deemster's constables and committed to jail, where he is visited at night by his father, the Bishop, who gives him an opportunity to escape. Dan refuses to go, feeling that he must atone for Ewan's death. Dan is tried on Tynwald Hill, the ancient law mount. The Deemster insists that the Bishop shall exercise his legal prerogative as the highest civil power on the isle and sit at this trial. He aims to force the Bishop to sentence his own son on the gallows. Dan is convicted. The Deemster insists on the death sentence being passed by the Bishop, who, instead of condemning Dan to be hanged, decrees that his son shall be cut off from the people, no tongue to speak to him, no hand to touch him, and. in death, no hand to bury him. Dan is driven away, and for seven years lives alone in a hut by the sea. Then a plague strikes the people of Man. The Bishop has learned of a monk in Ireland who has discovered an antidote for the pestilence and sends for him. The monk comes to the isle on a vessel which is wrecked on the shore near Dan's desolate hut. He dies in Dan's arms, who then dons the monk's garb and carries the antidote to the people, as he had been commanded by the dying cleric. When there is but one powder of the antidote left Dan learns that the Deemster is a victim of the plague. When he faces his enemy to minister to him. he finds himself stricken. Either he or the Deemster must die. Revealing himself to the Deemster he chooses to die himself, hopeless under his father's irrevocable sentence to a living death. Giving the Deemster the healing powder he staggers away to his hut. There he is followed by Mona and dies in her arms.",,"tt0007845",,,"movie"

He takes his daughter, Octavia, to pay a visit to her relatives, especially Miss Belinda Bassett, an aunt whom she has never seen. The father is called to America by an important business cable, and Octavia goes on alone to her aunt. Slowbridge, the home of this aunt, is a sleepy little English village whose snobbish small town aristocracy is headed by the pompous Lady Theobald. Lady Theobald has everyone under her thumb, including Miss Bassett and her own granddaughter, Lucia, a sweet, shy English girl. Octavia has about the effect of a dynamite bomb in Slowbridge. Her dresses, her breezy ways, her unconventional conduct, all infuriate Lady Theobald, and at first terrify her aunt. Little by little, however, Octavia becomes a general favorite. She enjoys engineering a love affair between the bashful Lucia and a fine young man, who because he is a mere manufacturer, and not a ""gentleman of leisure," has no social standing in Slowbridge. The worst blow to Lady Theobald comes when her nephew, Captain Barold, becomes exceedingly fond of Octavia. His manner of demonstrating his affection does not please Octavia, for he seems to feel that he is doing her a tremendous favor in bestowing his affection upon her. She decides to teach him a lesson. Lady Theobald wants Captain Barold to marry her niece, Lucia. Lucia, however, is in love with the manufacturer. Lady Theobald is horrified when she sees Octavia snatching this wonderful catch away from Lucia. Just when Slowbridge is about to blow up with agitation, Captain Barold puts his fortune to the test. He asks Octavia to marry him. She refuses, thereby succeeding in injuring his bump of conceit. Octavia's father arrives with the news that he is more than a millionaire; that his mining stock has recently doubled in value. With him comes Jack Belsays, an energetic American youth who is a type as foreign to Slowbridge as Octavia. What is the surprise of the small township to learn that Octavia has been engaged to Jack all the time, and never at all anxious to fasten herself upon English small town society or to intrude into their affairs. A marriage ceremony follows in Miss Bassett's little villa with young Poppleton, the curate officiating. Through Octavia's good offices, another wedding follows later, that of Lucia and the young manufacturer, whom even Lady Theobald has come to realize is fully worthy of respect, and of the hand of her granddaughter, Lucia.",,"tt0007926",,,"movie"

The neighbors said it was a shame the way he neglected his poor wife, but Tillie's avoirdupois seemed to belie the rumor. Directly above lived the Pipkins. In this case, however, it was the young wife whose numerous clubs called her frequently from her fireside, affording gossip for the neighbors. However, unmindful of the discussion of their affairs, Tillie continued to cook dainty dishes for her unappreciative husband, while Luella Pipkin found fault with everything her meek husband did to please her. For several weeks it happened that Tinkelpaw and Luella would accidentally meet at the door, and naturally would walk down the street together. However, on one occasion where Mr. Tinkelpaw had been less appreciative than usual, and departed leaving Tillie in tears, she went to the window, hoping he might relent and throw her a kiss. At the same time Luella was out of sorts on account of having lost at bridge, and when she left, Pipkin also went to the window to see if she had really gone. What they saw affected them like a cold plunge. Both of them wrote to their faithless mates informing them that all was over; and on starting out into the world met in the hallway. Each recognized in the other a kindred soul; so linking arms, they set forth. On Luella's return she found the note, and frantically started in search of her husband. Tinkelpaw had also found a similar communication; so together they left in search of the truants. After following a devious trail they came upon them as they were attempting to use a photographer's automobile as an ocean liner. As the bedraggled Tillie is enfolded in her repentant husband's arms she winks slyly at Pipkin who is being fondled by a much chastened Luella.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzY5MWYxMTEtYmVmMi00ZmRhLTg5NTYtMzI5MjZhNzA0NTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008679","7.3","384","movie"

As punishment for her first offense, she was sent to bed without supper, but neither her father nor mother could sleep when they realized that Mary was hungry, so they caught each other bringing food to the youngster.

From then on, day after day, the child visited him and brought cheer to the big mansion, which had never known the sound of childish laughter. On the off days, when not at the big house, Mary and Piggy ran wild for ways in which to make passersby lose their seriousness and smile.

Hoel Kalloc, her betrothed, becomes jealous, and George marries her, after saving her from Hoel's brutality. He soon realizes her inferiority and the impossibility of introducing her as his wife; so he sends her to a convent to be educated, promising to send for her as soon as she has acquired the polish necessary in his sphere of life. Returning to America, he keeps his marriage a secret and is struggling to forget, when he receives a note that a girl, who she has named after him, has been born to her. George later meets Cynthia Ford, with whom he falls in love, and on receiving word of the death of Renée and the baby in a fire in the convent, they become betrothed. However, during the following winter, Renée reappears, and when George denies that he knows her, she leaves her baby in the care of her landlady and goes away. The next morning in the snow in front of their house the Crosbys find her body. Clutched in her hand is the crucifix George had given her, on the back of which had been scratched the word ""pardon." The landlady identifies her as the mother of the baby who has been left in her care, and George, placing the crucifix around the baby's neck, pays the landlady to take care of her. Four years pass and a daughter, Georgianna is born to Cynthia and George. In the meantime, Georgette wanders away from the landlady's home and is adopted by a barge captain. Raoul Kerouac, now a French naval officer, comes to inquire for his lost sister, Renée. Seeing Cynthia's child, he mistakes her for Georgette. George writes a confession, revealing the truth, but Cynthia destroys the confession without reading it, on account of her faith in George. Sixteen years later, George is now Judge Crosby, while Georgette has secretly married Val, the reprobate son of Mrs. Lewis, in whose home she is employed as a maid. In an effort to cure him of his love for drink, his mother sends Val away, and Georgette is left alone. A girl is brought before Judge Crosby, charged with murdering her baby, and her conviction seems assured. Among the evidence is a crucifix with the word "pardon" scratched on the back. The judge is seized with apoplexy, as realizing the prisoner is his daughter, he sentences her to death. He has pronounced his last sentence. Cynthia's love for George survives all else; she strives to secure Georgette's freedom, and finally gets word to Val in the far north, whose answer states the baby is safe with him.

The Amalgamated Hardware Company, a trust, make Mike and Louie an offer on their place, which they refuse. Amid their denunciation of the trust Madge and her sweetheart, Jack Kennedy, enter. Jack has come to ask Madge's uncles for her hand, but they will give Jack no answer. That evening Madge is told the story of her life. Her father, while mining in the West, was killed by a blast and she has been raised by Mike and Louie, who are informed by John Andrews that her father passed away leaving nothing. Jack's father, ""Boss" Kennedy, is the silent partner with John Andrews, none other than the former partner to Madge's father, in the Amalgamated Hardware Company. Though a crook, Kennedy endeavors to keep his actions from his boy. Andrews and Kennedy decide to squash the two Dutchmen by opening a store across the street and underselling them. Eventually the trust forces the foreigners out of business. Madge gets a position in a laundry where an alkaline tank explodes and blinds her. Andrews and Kennedy argue and vow "to get" each other. Mike and Louie read that a specialist has come to town, who can perform an operation upon the blind which will enable them to see, but charges $300 for his service. Mike and Louie offer to sell their store to Kennedy, who refuses them. He refers them to Andrews if they are in search of charity. Leaving Jack in charge of the store, Mike and Louie visit Andrews. Introducing Madge as Miss Morton, the Dutchmen do not notice that Andrews is surprised. He informs them that he will think about it. Madge's name causes visions of the past and Andrews sees his old partner as he died begging Andrews to take care of his child, for which he wills him one-half interest in his mine. After Morton's death the mine paid enormously and Andrews took no further interest in Madge other than to inform her guardians that she had been left nothing by her father. Andrews is informed that Kennedy is double-crossing him and that Jack is caring for the store across the street. Andrews buys the store for $500. Crooks learn that Mike and Louie have $500 and that night rob them of their money. The crooks are captured and in the night court Mike and Louie accuse them. The crooks send for Kennedy who arrives with Jack, and the "Boss" has his henchmen released and Mike and Louie get the worst end of it. Jack, realizing his father's actions, demands an explanation, which results in an argument and the boy leaves his father's house. Intent upon revenge, Mike and Louie steal into Kennedy's house and rob him of $500, which pays for Madge's operation. Inspired by their success, they go out to make another haul and accidentally get into Andrews' home, where they rob his private safe and get a tin box which they take home. On opening it, they find evidence to prove Andrews' guilt and resolve on revenge. Madge is released from the hospital, able to see again. Andrews in attempting to get even with Kennedy, frames circumstantial evidence proving Jack guilty of stealing the tin box. In the court trial everything is going against Jack when Mike and Louie jump up and confess. Andrews makes a get-away, but Mike and Louie are sentenced to two years in State prison. For one year they are remorseful but later are shown as trusted trusties. They speak to their fellow convicts and impress upon them the folly of wrong-doing; they avert a break in the prison, and are in truth "beloved rogues." One day they are called to the warden's house to set a banquet table, where they are interrupted by the entrance of Madge, Jack Kennedy, the Governor of the State, and a clergyman, and invited to the wedding of Madge, having been released by the Governor.",,"tt0167039",,,"movie"

She refuses him, and marries Aaron King. A son, Aaron King, Jr., is born to them. John Willard, who does not approve of the intimacy between his sister, Myra, and James Rutlidge, provokes a quarrel with Rutlidge. Thinking he has killed him, Willard goes West. A baby is born to Myra, who does not know that Rutlidge has a wife. Mrs. Rutlidge learns of it. Crazed with jealousy, she seeks Myra, throws acid in her face, marring her for life; then commits suicide. With Myra's permission, Rutlidge takes the baby to raise with his son, James Rutlidge, Jr., and shares his wealth equally between them. Myra refuses his offers of money, and writes to John Willard, her brother, asking for help. In California, he holds up a mail stage to get money for her fare west. Willard is arrested. Myra, ignorant of this, goes to Graymont, Cal. Not finding her brother, she wanders into the mountains and to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Andres, who take her in. She is like a mother to Sybil, Andres' only child. Years pass. Aaron King, in financial difficulties and disgrace, dies. LaGrange, who has prospered, pays some of Mrs. King's debts and again asks her to marry him. She refuses, saying her life belongs to her boy. Mrs. King, sacrifices all to keep Aaron, her son, now a young man, in a Paris art school. Graduating with high honors, he receives word that his mother is ill, and rushes home in time to see her die. The Story: Twenty-five years have elapsed. Aaron King, Jr. leaves for the West. On the same train are Gertrude Taine; her husband, Edward Taine, many years her senior, a wreck; and Louise Taine, stepdaughter of Mrs. Taine. They are met by James Rutlidge, Jr. Myra, who now lives in Fairlands, recognizes Mrs. Taine and Rutlidge. King becomes acquainted with LaGrange. Friendship springs up between the pair. King is commissioned to paint Mrs. Taine's portrait. He and LaGrange take a cottage next, to Sybil and Myra. Rutlidge annoys Sybil with his attentions. King and LaGrange meet Sybil. Mrs. Taine becomes infatuated with King. John Willard (now known as John Marston) escapes from prison. He meets Rutlidge, who befriends him and bides him in a mountain cabin. Mrs. Taine is pleased with the portrait. As King contrasts Sybil with Mrs. Taine, he sees the latter as a designing soul in a beautiful body. Refusing to let her have the portrait, he asks her to pose again. Thinking she has infatuated King, she consents. He also paints Sybil's portrait. Mrs. Taine gives a reception in honor of King and LaGrange. She tries to influence King by causing Sybil to play her violin as one of the paid performers. Mr. Taine collapses in the midst of a speech and is carried off, dying. Mrs. Taine, visiting King's studio, finds him absent. Sybil comes in. Mrs. Taine, bringing in the fact that Sybil was up in the mountains with Myra while LaGrange and King were on a camping trip in the mountains, convinces Sybil that the world thinks she is the artist's mistress. Sybil stops long enough to write a note for Myra, and then rides away. Myra tells King of Sybil's disappearance. He follows her, and enlists the aid of Brian Oakley, the forest ranger. Rutlidge learns of Sybil's departure. By threatening Marston with exposure, he forces him to kidnap Sybil. Marston takes her to a cabin. Oakley, King and a posse of men search the mountains for her. King goes to Granite Peak, but Rutlidge gets there first. Rutlidge makes the proposition that they throw down their guns and fight it out. As Rutlidge is about to throw King over the cliff. Marston appears with Sybil, who begs him to save King. He shoots Rutlidge, who topples over the cliff. Then Marston disappears. King and Sybil go back to town. Sybil has discovered that she loves King and that he loves her. Mrs. Taine goes to the studio. She sees herself on the canvas as King sees her, and flies into a rage. She threatens to blast King's career and to ruin Sybil's reputation. LaGrange, overhearing, brings Myra in and has her tell her story. As Mrs. Taine listens, she bares her shoulder, showing a scar which identifies her as Myra's daughter. LaGrange threatens if she ever speaks ill of Sybil or King to publish the story broadcast Mrs. Taine retreats. Later, Sybil, learning from LaGrange that King has completed his masterpiece, goes to the studio. King takes her in his arms.",,"tt0007909",,,"movie"

Luckily for Jan, he finds a farewell letter in the park, including a large sum of money. Meanwhile, the owner's son Leo confesses his love for Jan's daughter Annie, but Van Haaften forbids their marriage. Because of Jan's nephew Willem Berg's ongoing spying attempts to gain knowledge of the secret recipe, Jan buys Van Haaften a gun to defend himself against the villain. One night, as Willem has secretly entered the factory, Van Haaften enters his office to find a letter from a friend with a sum of money, that is not nearly large enough to cover his losses. He writes a suicide note and shoots himself, after which Willem enters the office and steals the money and the note. When, on the following morning, Jan has finally succeeded in rediscovering the recipe and goes to show the result to Van Haaften, he finds him dead. With all circumstances against him, he is thrown in prison, but he manages to slip his daughter Lilly the just-discovered recipe. While Willem's attempts to gain hold of the recipe get more and more violent, Lilly tries to gather evidence of her father's innocence.

Perry sees June, who has been sent away from the poorhouse. He shares his lunch with her and protects her from the attentions of Ben Boone, the political bully of the town. June finds a home with old Jacob and Cindy Tutwiler, taking the place of their own daughter, whom Jacob had banished from home eighteen years before, and whose picture has been turned to the wall. Perry becomes the conservative candidate for Congress, opposing Ben Boone, who is the candidate of the liberal party. Perry asks June to marry him if he proves successful. Perry receives a call from Sue Eudaly, with whom he has gone through a marriage ceremony, but whom he left on finding she had a husband living. Her husband, Jim White, has disappeared, and she defies Perry to prove her previous marriage. She threatens to go to the rival candidate with her information, and Col. Risener, as Perry's campaign manager, buys her off. June is alarmed at the interest Sue shows in the man she loves, and Perry urges her to marry him at once, secretly. June continues to live with the Tutwilers. She has discovered that their daughter, who had married a hated Bascom, was her own mother, and that she is the granddaughter of Jacob and Cindy. Ben Boone has fallen in love with Sue, and his affection is returned. At the political rally June leads the village band, trying to drown out the voice of Boone when he harangues the crowd. The tide seems to be turning against Boone. Sue, deciding to explode a bomb in the camp of his opponents, takes her stand beside Perry and tells them he is a Bascom. She says she knows the wife he has deserted. June says that it is not true, since she herself is his wife. But the townspeople will not listen. They believe that he has deceived June, and refuse to believe anything good of a Bascom. The Tutwilers take June home with them and Perry is ordered to get out of town. Perry goes to the Tutwilers' to see June before he leaves. Sue is there. He denies that she is his wife, but she horrifies them all by saying that if Perry's father lured June's mother away from home. Perry and June are brother and sister. Cindy dispels that thought by producing a photograph of June's father. It is Jack Bascom, the half-brother of Perry's father, not a true Bascom by birth. Perry goes away to obtain proof of Sue Eudaly's husband, and June leaves the house, refusing to have anything to do with her grandfather until he retracts his insults to Perry. Ostracized by the townspeople, June lives in a humble cottage, where her child is born. Cindy goes to see the little one, but June will not permit Jacob to come until he admits that he is sorry. Perry at last returns with proof of Jim White's marriage to Sue. He seeks Boone at the mill. Boone cannot understand why Sue refuses to marry him. She finally tells him it is because she has a husband living, and that husband is Perry. Boone attacks Perry and overpowers him. Placing him on the log-carriage, he turns the great lever. He has locked June, who has followed her husband, inside the office. Then he and Sue make their escape. Through the glass door June watches her husband's body approaching the teeth of the saw. Breaking the glass of the door, she plunges out, and, reversing the lever just in time, saves Perry from the saw. Misfortune overtakes Sue and Boone, and with their baneful influence removed, June, Perry and the little one begin a happier life in the little town, with the love and respect of all.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjU1NzcxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQ4MTg5._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0007711","7.7","6","movie"

No undersea boat appears, however, and they are calmed. Max persuades the captain of the vessel to make. Maupain believe a U-boat has torpedoed the Espagne; simultaneously Maupain persuades the captain to make Max believe the same thing. That night the sailors douse Maupain with water and shout that the vessel has been torpedoed. He tells them they have made a mistake, and points to Max's cabin. They douse Max. A few moments later a freight steamer rams the Espagne. The passengers rush to the decks in terror. Max and Maupain, however, believe it is their joke. They discover, though, the truth, and both fight for the only remaining life preserver. Maupain gets it and rushes on deck. Max finds himself locked in the saloon. He is terror-stricken. Death faces him. Meantime in the hold of the boat the sailors are battling with the onrushing waters. They stop up the leak and all is safe. Max hears the captain reassuring the passengers.

Though she loves her father, she detests his associates, particularly one, Bill Whipple, who is her constant suitor, Joe Dunham, who does the scouting for the trio, finds a likely bank in the town of Wheaton, the fact that a new bookkeeper is needed there opening a way for the gang to get into the bank, as Nell is an expert. Working on her love for her father, who is a very sick man, Whipple and Dunham persuade Nell to go to Wheaton and take the position. Boarding with the Rev. Dr. Singleton, Nell wins the confidence of Jim Brooks, the cashier of the bank, and of Tom Hoadley, his best friend and sheriff of the county. What the girl is working for, of course, is the combination of the safe, but before she has a chance to get it, she begins to realize that she is in love with the cashier. On the very day that she learns the combination and copies it. Jim proposes to her, and, after a mental struggle, she decides that her love for him is greater than her loyalty to the gang, and she surrenders, concealing her identity, she had come to the town under an assumed name. Becoming suspicious of Nell's delay in forwarding word to them, Whipple and Dunham attempt to force her father to write a note ordering her to act quickly, but the old man refuses and is shot. The crooks go to Wheaton and try to force Nell to rob the bank. She has undergone complete reformation and has even confessed her identity to Jim's friend and is planning to leave Wheaton rather than bring disgrace upon the man she loves. She discovers that her father has been murdered by the crooks and decides to be revenged. Apparently consenting to their demands, she gets them into the bank, but not until she has warned the sheriff.

Peter Madison, mayor of the city, is at enmity with Millionaire Brownlee over political matters. He has a son, Jimmy Madison, who is masquerading as a uniformed policeman in order to detect grafters on the force. Brownlee secures what he believes to be evidence of political crookedness on the part of the mayor. The documents are lost when Betty, in one of her escapades, drives off with the car in which her father has left them. Jimmy arrests Betty for stealing the car and papers, being unaware of her identity. Betty and Jimmy fall in love, and the denouement does not come until Millionaire Brownlee's suspicions against Mayor Madison are proved unfounded and the two men shake hands. Jimmy reveals himself to Betty in his true character and the drama ends happily.",,"tt0167041",,,"movie"

His mental mood has worried his friends and when his true condition of mind is disclosed by the discovery that he is reading a book entitled ""Famous Suicides," action becomes necessary. One of Van Seer's club friends has recently visited a fortune teller, known as "The Mysterious Mrs. M.," and relates his experiences to Van Seer. As a result of the combined urgings of his friends, Van Seer visits the sorceress. When she tells Van Seer that on a given date be will meet with a painful accident while out of doors, Van Seer hopes to thwart whatever truth there may be in her prognostication by remaining indoors, at his club, all day. Despite the invitations of his friends to venture forth, Van Seer sticks within his room until late in the afternoon, fire is discovered in the clubhouse and, with the other occupants, Van Seer rushes forth. Just as he is crossing the threshold, he trips, falls headlong to the sidewalk and breaks his wrist. He will have none of the attentions offered by the club physician, but takes his machine and rides to his country seat, where he submits his broken wrist to the treatment of Dr. Woodman, the family physician. Prompted by a desire to further test the abilities of the seeress, Van Seer again visits "The Mysterious Mrs. M." She informs him that on a certain date, still three months away, he is to die suddenly. As a token of his disbelief Van Seer gives her an order on his executor to pay her an immense sum of money if he shall die in accord with Mrs. Musselwhite's prophecy. The fortune teller hands him back the order, stating that his money will do her no good as she is herself going to die within a week. Van Seer bribes the fortune teller's butler to keep him advised of Mrs. Musselwhite's health. On the day the woman has set for her death, the butler calls Van Seer to the phone and informs him that Mrs. Musselwhite has died. Being now thoroughly convinced of the woman's ability Van Seer contemplates the likelihood of his own death as specified, but now he wants to live. Dr. Woodman's daughter, Phyllis, has come home from college. Van Seer has fallen in love with her, but believing that his day of death is fixed by fate he refrains from advancing his own cause while all the time Phyllis is in love with him. So matters continue until Van Seer's last day on earth. He spends the hours alone, locked in his library, watching the hands of the clock approach the hour of midnight. When at last the hour of midnight arrives and passes with Van Seer still alive he is suddenly aroused to the realities of life by having his club friends burst in upon him with a letter from "The Mysterious Mrs. M." She has, all along, acted in the employ of Van Seer's club friends and has prognosticated and acted along previously decided lines. Rejoicing in his good health, good fortune and the love of Phyllis, there is the happy ending of Van Seer's romance of life and death.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0NjAxMTIzMzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ2NDYyNTQx._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008351",,,"movie"

Dick Harcourt. Ruth's brother, a ne'er do well, who by the will of their father was the executor of her privately owned estate, squanders it in riotous living, and reaching the end of his resources, after losing quite a large sum of money to Neil Sumner, his brother-in-low, commits suicide. This brings an end to the married life of Ruth and Neil. She blames Neil for Dick's untimely end, and proceeds to get a divorce. Neil tails in with a part of the so-called ""fast set" in New York. During this period, Ruth has lived in London with Cynthia. Ruth determines to return to America. When Ruth's brother Dick committed suicide, he left a letter, addressed to the family lawyer, telling him that he had dissipated Ruth's entire fortune. The lawyer, who is a friend of Neil's tells him of this circumstance, and asks him what the outcome will be for Ruth. Neil generously offers to continue paying the dividends on all the stocks Ruth still supposes she owns, knowing nothing of the defalcation of her brother. Ruth and Cynthia arrive in New York, and that same night Betsy, Neil's sister, who is very fond of Ruth, asks her if she will allow Cynthia to go with her to pay a short call to her father. Ruth consents, much to Cynthia's delight, and they arrive at Neil's house in the middle of a hilarious party, attended by some of his sporting friends. Neil decides to open his Port Washington home for the first time since Ruth has departed with the baby. Coming back from the race one day, some of Neil's sporting friends meet Cynthia on the street, and some of them, knowing who she is, invite her to go with them to the Red Lion Inn for some refreshment. She, in her innocence, accepts. Neil, happening to pass the Red Lion, sees the party coming out. He takes her in his car with Mrs. Palmer, a lady whose name has been coupled with his in gossip, and takes her home. Ruth, reading in the town topics that same day some of the gossip connecting Neil with Mrs. Palmer's name, the lady he was riding with, decides that the only safe way is to get Cynthia and return to London. Several months later Neil finds himself in London, where he also meets the family lawyer, Mr. Fellowes. Fellowes, who all these years has been trying to effect a reconciliation between Ruth and Neil, hits upon the happy idea of taking Neil to Ruth's home, determined there to tell Ruth that Neil, all these years, has been supporting her. While they are discussing the ways and means of fixing Ruth's fortune so that she may never know, she overhears their conversation. Cynthia, hearing her daddy's voice, rushes into the room and embraces him frantically, telling him that she is to be married the next day, and that she will go and bring her fiancé for his approval. She does so, and when she enters with him, Neil has just finished making an unsuccessful plea to Ruth for the restoration of their happiness, and it is the sweet love of the young girl for both her mother and father that brings this beautiful play to a happy ending.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzc0Y2U3NGEtMjFjYy00NTJjLTk3MWUtZGZlNDc1M2I3Zjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008494",,,"movie"

The children scream, ""Polly, put the kettle on," but she finds only a few tea leaves. The kids are disappointed when they find no jam. Polly, though only eighteen, has been mothering these children a long time. Polly enters her father's workroom, where he is poring over the plans for the invention which he is confident will bring them riches. He becomes irritated when Polly reminds him of their poverty, and she leaves the room. Polly obtains a position with Johanna Webb, a spinster. Chester Creigg, Miss Webb's nephew, has completed his preparations for leaving home. He is returning to college, this being his finishing year. Chester is impressed with Polly's good looks and there seems to be a mutual attraction. After some weeks Polly is overjoyed to learn that Chester is coming home. Chester has been awarded a prize at college for writing the best play. In the meantime Vance, Polly's father, has completed his invention. He takes the model to a well-known manufacturer, only to be told that the invention is already on the market. Chester has a tilt with his aunt because he will not submit to her arrangement for him to enter a bank, as he has chosen play-writing for his profession, and she disinherits him. Polly comes in with some wool and the old lady finds it is not the right color. Chester listens as the spinster scolds Polly. Polly is told to leave, and they go off together. Chester cannot convince Polly that it is the proper thing for her to allow him to help her until she gets another job. As he walks aimlessly on he is attracted by an excited crowd. He finds a man has fallen and been injured. He takes him home and has the doctor called. Polly comes home and finds Chester at her father's bedside. She is overcome with emotion at his goodness. Later Chester prevails on Polly to allow him to send her to the hospital for training as a nurse. While she is there Chester takes care of the family, though he is hard up, not having sold any of his plays. On a visit to Polly's house he finds a fire started accidentally by one of the children. He is overcome by an explosion of the father's chemicals and is taken to the hospital, after risking his life in rescuing the children. One of the neighbors comes to the hospital and tells Polly she will care for the children if Polly will nurse Chester. Chester is made blind by the fire. Polly feels it is incumbent upon her to help him, so she secretly goes to the old aunt and tells her of her nephew's plight. She says that Chester has sworn not to touch a cent of hers. They hit upon the plan to tell Chester his aunt has suddenly died, leaving all her wealth to him. In this way he is brought to her old home with Polly as his nurse. Polly in the meantime has sent his finished play to a play-broker. A friend of Chester's, Pendleton, a famous oculist, comes rushing in his old boyish fashion and brings the newspaper speaking of the great new play, "Polly Put the Kettle On," and of the mystery surrounding the identity of the author. Of course, it is Chester's play, and he bemoans the fate that makes it impossible for him to see his first play. Pendleton suggests an operation. Polly takes care of the patient. Her sweet face is the first thing that greets Chester's restored vision. He is too overcome for words. But he finds the speech when he sees his aunt Johanna. Her spirit has been refined in the fires of adversity, and there is a happy reunion.",,"tt0007199",,,"movie"

In Powhatan, a mining town controlled by Van Loan, Bessie, a sweet motherless child of Jasper Hunt, a mine foreman, lives with their housekeeper, Mrs. Flannigan. The mining company raises the price of food stuffs at the only store; the men resent this, and failing to get increased pay, strike. Van Loan refuses to yield and decides to use scab labor. Scenes of violence follow and, compelled to go to Powhatan, Van Loan takes Fay with him. Fay meets and plays with Bessie and for fun they change dresses. Separated, the unusual likeness deceives the Van Loan governess, who supposes Bessie to be Fay and whisks her away. Mrs. Flannigan finds and takes Fay, sick from exposure, to the Hunt home. Business hurriedly recalls Van Loan and mistaken for a changed Fay, Bessie revolutionizes the Van Loan household by her sweetness. Hunt, the real leader of the striking men, is summoned to meet Van Loan. During the unsuccessful arbitration meeting, Bessie comes in to bid her ""grandfather" good night and, seeing her father, rushes to his arms. Hunt, busy with the strike, supposes her to be ill at home. They are all dumbfounded. Bessie tells them how she and Fay changed clothes. Looking up the family trees, the likeness of the "twin" kiddies is explained, and, completely won over, Van Loan yields to the men and Hunt is made mine superintendent. Years of dread follow, and just as a report of the other's death reaches him, his foe appears, immensely wealthy and wreaks the vengeance in a spectacular manner.",,"tt0008706",,,"movie"

Edson, McGill and Slade, three enterprising crooks, own the Moonflower, a worthless mine. Slade goes east to unload and hearing of Faith's good fortune, she falls an easy prey, buying a share in the mine for nine thousand dollars. Advised by friends to take a rest, Faith goes to inspect her mine. Arriving at the town, she is insultingly approached and the man who has annoyed her is knocked down by Jim Ralston, a young mining engineer. She goes to the home of Big Annie, who tells her that the mine is worthless. The miners, touched by her beauty and helplessness, engage her to teach their school, the only available pupils being Pete, a half-wit, and Jim, who is held in connection with a hold-up committed by Edson and McGill. At first Jim rebels, but when he sees the teacher, he becomes a willing student. Faith recognizes him as her protector. Jim conceives the idea of salting the mine, and wires Slade to the effect that the mine is rich with silver and not to sell. Slade returns. Edson and McGill, pursued by a posse, reach the schoolhouse and persuade Jim to conceal them. Flynn, at the head of the posse, accuses Jim of hiding the bandits and is killed by a shot from an unseen hand. Jim is arrested as the murderer. Faith intercedes, begs him to flee and is handcuffed to him. They escape and take refuge in a mountain cabin. Jim shoots the fetter apart, breaking his wrist, and insists that Faith return home. As Jim tells Slade of Faith's whereabouts, Slade notices the fetter on his hand, takes him to the outskirts of the town and the miners prepare to bang him. Faith sells her interest in the mine back to Slade, and Pete, as he delivers a note to her from Jim, also tells Faith of Jim's peril. The outlaws, Edson and McGill, are shot as they resist arrest, Edson's dying confession of Flynn's murder reaching Jim's executioners just as they refuse to listen to Faith's pleading for her lover's life.

Lew does not appreciate the arrival of Clayborn, as he realizes that Bess likes him as does Tess, but Clayborn considers the latter but a child. Bess promises her father that she will not marry so long as he lives, so Lew builds three or four stills on Harding's place and then informs the revenue officers that Harding is operating stills. During his calls, Clayborn visits the home of one of the men who is dying and has worked for Lew and has been mistreated. He tells him of the plot and Clayborn arrives at the station just in time to meet the officers and explain that it was only a trick against Harding. Lew, who has laid his plans well, has taken a couple of jugs of moonshine to Harding's, plied him with drinks, until he is in a drunken stupor. Clayborn secures the aid of Bess and they destroy the stills, but the old man, hearing a noise, takes his gun and shoots Clayborn in the arm. That night, Lew sends word for Bess to meet Clayborn at a certain house and sends word to Clayborn to meet her at the same place. When the minister arrives, he is beaten and taken to the loft. When Bess arrives she learns of the ruse that has been played upon her and Lew demands that she marry him or he will have her father sent to prison. He threatens Clayborn with damaging Bess' name if he will not marry them. Just as he is on the point of performing the ceremony, the officers fire the house.

Maxfield Durant, an artist, who painted her portrait when she first came to the city, had also fallen in love with her, but before he declared his love, she accepted Vincent. He advertises for a model who is beautiful, but not of the brazen type, and secures Peggy Lovel, a girl from the slums.

Priscilla, remembering her portrait, requests Durant to bring it to her. He cannot refrain from showing his great love. Vincent, seeing this, flies into a terrible rage.

She gazes into a crystal which they brought from Egypt, and views scenes of horror, but her love for her husband renews her faith in him.

This throws Peggy out of employment, and she goes to Vincent, seeking help for herself and invalid mother. Billy, intoxicated, wants her, but Vincent sends her away, and takes Billie to his home.

He has promised Jacob Babcock, his first mate, that his daughter, Esther, shall become Babcock's wife. But Esther is in love with Caleb Tilden, her childhood sweetheart, and her grandfather, in sympathetic interest, advises her to marry Caleb and run the chance of gaining her father's forgiveness. The Alden Besse is at sea when Esther's marriage to Tilden takes place. At about the same time Grandfather Whitaker dies. Jacob Babcock has remained ashore for the purpose of marrying Esther, and when the Alden Besse returns and her skipper finds that his daughter has not married Babcock, his anger is intense. Accidentally he discovers, in Esther's sewing basket, a baby's stocking, and divines the truth. He compels Esther to board the Alden Besse, locking her in a cabin. Then he seeks out Caleb Tilden, and in a fight believes he has killed him. Tilden, however, has simply been stunned and when Whitaker throws him from the wharf his sudden immersion in the cold water revives Tilden and he manages to crawl to a string-piece under the dock. At that moment the Alden Besse is sailing, and Tilden watches her with frenzied interest. He sees Esther as she runs to the stern and attempts to jump overboard. Esther's father drags the girl back to her cabin and there she is securely imprisoned. The cook of the craft, Eben Wiggs, is the only man on board who has any sympathy for the girl. The cook cares for her, even when her child is subsequently born. Babcock is sailing on the Alden Besse, and when Whitaker tries to compel his daughter to marry the mate, Esther declares that she will throw herself into the sea before allowing her father to conclude the marriage ceremony. Whitaker, in disgust, abandons his purpose. Later the seamen join in mutiny and kill Whitaker, their leader being Jacob Babcock. In the meantime, Tilden has tried to come upon the Alden Besse by shipping as a sailor in a craft that sailed the same sea the Besse usually did, and has found her lying in Panama Bay. When he attempts to board the Besse, Captain Whitaker thinks he sees the ghost of the man he believes he has killed, and drives Tilden from the ship. Tilden returns home and waits for the return of the Alden Besse. The mutiny has broken out as the ship is approaching her home port. There is a fierce storm approaching at the time, and when it breaks the Besse is wrecked. Tilden heads the villagers who go to the rescue, and is the one who wades into the water and secures a raft upon which Esther and her baby have been lashed by the cook. The reunion follows and the final cruise of the Alden Besse becomes tradition.",,"tt0008340",,,"movie"

At the age of eighteen she was courageous and self-reliant, also self-willed and independent, with a disregard for the restraints of convention. She caused gossip by fishing on Sunday and galloping wildly about on her colt. An old friend, Mrs. Travers, and her son, Jimmy, visit them. Jimmy and Penelope become friendly. Mrs. Travers induces the father to allow Penelope to enter a fashionable boarding school with her daughter. Marjorie. At the school Penelope's behavior is not as dignified as it should be. Her father dies and Penelope refuses to see her friends or return to school. Jimmy finally persuades her to come and make his mother a visit. She goes and at a party in her honor meets Mr. and Mrs. Rivers and enjoys Rivers' company, causing his wife much anger. At the golf club she continues flirting and Jimmy remonstrates with her without success. Mrs. Rivers puts detectives on her husband's trail and they follow Rivers and Penelope to a roadhouse. On the way Jimmy joins them. They arrive just as Rivers is beginning to show his real self to Penelope and she faints. The detectives take Rivers away, while Jimmy goes to Penelope. Mrs. Rivers starts a divorce suit, naming Penelope as a co-respondent. Penelope goes to Mrs. Rivers and pleads with her. Mrs. Rivers sees she is innocent and returns with her to the Travers' home, where Jimmy takes her into his arms.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNTEzNDU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODc5Mjg5._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0176850",,,"movie"

He is visited by York Cantrell, an Easterner, whose mining interests keep him in the vicinity. They stand at the office window watching two sisters, Grace and Daisy Burton. The girls are insulted by men hanging around the Forty Rod saloon and dance hall, run by ""Deacon" Doyle and secretly owned by York Cantrell. Tulliver rushes to their assistance and incurs the enmity of Doyle. The next day Truthful states, under big headlines, that Doyle must go, and the following morning finds a notice on his door that Doyle will be in the Forty Rod Saloon at ten o'clock, and there is not a pen pusher in Arizona that can run him out of town. Truthful surprises Doyle and his henchmen by coming into the saloon through a rear door, and. from his horse, lassoes and pulls them out into the desert, where he tells them never to return to Glory Hole. That night Truthful is shot at from York Cantrell's room by Doyle, who has returned. Truthful then drives both from town, not knowing that York has wronged Daisy Burton. Daisy confesses to Grace, and Grace finds Truthful, who, misunderstanding, thinks she is the one who cares for Cantrell. He promises to bring him back, and reaches the railroad, intercepts Cantrell, and forces him to return. Then understanding comes. Cantrell wants to marry Daisy and live a new life, and Truthful comprehends his mistake. Grace turns toward him, with her thanks and relief, and sees him watching her with such eloquent eyes that hers fall for a moment. Then she comes to him and with happy faces, hands clasped, they see York Cantrell married to the sister, and as the priest blesses them, Truthful clasps her close.",,"tt0007479",,,"movie"

Little Carol is a hopeless invalid, and the tender love and affection of the entire family go out to her, fearing the day when the soul shall take its flight from the fragile body. Carol has a devoted Uncle Jack also, a traveler in distant lands, who cheers her by a letter, in which he promises to come home and spend Christmas with her. But little Carol has other friends, outside of her sphere indeed, but nevertheless faithful, loyal friends, who would go any length to spare her pain or to bring her pleasure. These are none other than the nine ragged members of the Ruggles family, little boys and girls who live nearby, whom Carol has often watched at play and wished that she could join them. Mrs. Ruggles, their widowed mother, toils ceaselessly to bring up this healthy brood of hers, from Sarah Maude, the elder, and the little mother, down to sturdy little Larry, the pet and pride of the Ruggles' family. Shortly before Christmas, Carol, who had been planning for some time to give a pleasant surprise to her Ruggles friends, asks her mother if she can invite them to a Christmas dinner. Mrs. Bird gladly consents, and so the letter of invitation is written by Carol and is carried to Mrs. Ruggles by Sarah Maude. The commotion which this letter creates is best told in the pictures, as are also the preparations made by Mrs. Ruggles to have her children appear in presentable condition. The mirth which these preparations create seizes the spectator with such continuous grip that he loses the sense of time and place. He is truly in the midst of it all, at times earnestly sympathizing with Mrs. Ruggles in the knotty problems that confront her and sincerely admiring the resourcefulness that overcomes every difficulty. Peory, for instance, has no stockings, and Mrs. Ruggles surmounts the difficulty by telling Clem, her eldest boy, to go out and ask Mrs. Cullen, a neighbor, to lend her a pair and to promise that Peory will give her boy Jim Cullen half of her candy. Peory flares up at this bargain, but Mrs. Ruggles settles the matter by asking: ""Which would you rather do. Give Jim half your candy or go to the party barelegged?" The said stockings arc a sight, striped, not like a zebra, but black and white! "Thay'll be the makin' of you! Ain't they stylish, Peory?" Mrs. Ruggles says to that disgruntled young lady, as she surveys them with delight. Then in an aside to the other gazing members of the family, Mrs. Ruggles says confidently, "Nobody'll fergit she's got 'em on." This is only a single sample of the mirthful preparations, not omitting the dress rehearsal to which Mrs. Ruggles subjects her brood, before they depart for the Bird mansion. They are certain to delight both old and young, and people of all ages. The scene showing the Ruggles' family around the Christmas table, with Uncle Jack seated at the head and the invalid Carol looking delightedly on, will remain with everyone who sees it for some time to come. The director has seen to it that the Ruggles children eat just as they have been accustomed to eat at home, and Larry eats so ravenously that his face soon begins to pucker up with pain, which comes from an over-gorged "tummie." The closing scene is one of sadness. The merry Ruggles children have gone, laden with beautiful Christmas presents, taken from Carol's Christmas tree. In her mother's arms, the child is seized by a great faintness. "Mother, I do think we have kept Christ's birthday this time just as He wanted it done," she whispers, and then passes away.",,"tt0168513","4.7","11","movie"

When they arrive at the island, they find only a girl, Leila, who was shipwrecked with her father long before. Leila is so glad to see white men again that she eagerly shows them a bag of beautiful pearls brought up from the ocean bed by her father, who disappeared shortly afterward. The pearls are so tempting to the Australian and the Chinese that they form a combination against Leila and the reporter, Bruce Chalmers, when the latter refuses to aid them in robbing the girl.

As recompense, Morris gives Newman his vest in which are sewed four valuable diamonds. Newman is attracted by a girl who slaves for the proprietress of his boarding house. Georgianna, who is afraid of Newman, is arrested for the theft of several cheap rings belonging to the proprietress, which have been mislaid. While in prison Newman promises to pay her bail, if she is willing to meet his advances.

The new hole in the vest is discovered, and Morris is brought before the chief. The two are left alone and Morris hits the chief and disappears through the window. Georgianna's case is dismissed, but she thinks Newman is responsible for her being set free. On arriving at his rooms a fierce struggle ensues. A knock is heard and she is told to hide behind the couch. Morris enters the room and shoots Newman, who falls dead. Georgianna is held for the murder, Morris having escaped into the room adjoining Newman's, in which McHugh, a newspaper reporter, is dressing. Willy, a roustabout in the boarding-house, and an admirer of Georgianna's, becomes suspicious. He stacks furniture and looks through the transom when the furniture falls with a clamor. Morris is terrified and is about to draw his revolver when McHugh hits him with a bottle and then handcuffs him. Leaving Willy to guard the captive, he dashes to the police station and to his office to write up his scoop. Meantime, Bennett, another reporter, arrives and looking over the transom sees Morris still handcuffed and Willy guarding him.

At the reception, Brain sees one of the guests substitute a paste necklace for the diamond one that Betty wears, and he forces the man to give up his prize. When he returns the real necklace to Betty without explanation, she thinks that he took the ornament. A few days later Betty goes on a yachting party with friends. While she is holding Brain up to ridicule, by mimicking the native Indian dances, she topples over in the water. Brain rescues her. Meanwhile, Jennings' affairs in the West are not prospering. He cannot induce the old chief to sign the contract until his son, Brain, returns, and passes an opinion on it. So Brain is called west. Betty and her brother, Percy, follow him on the next train; the girl has resolved that she will force the Indians to sign the contract by using her wiles on Brain. The beginning is successful. She pretends to be thrown from her horse when she sees Brain nearby, and he picks her up and brings her safely to the Jennings cottage. Later he rescues the Jennings baby as it falls over a cliff. His repeated acts of heroism make Betty respect and admire him. But she keeps intent on her purpose. Betty finally induces Brain to recommend the signing of the contract. Then, her end accomplished, she laughs at his protestations of love, and tells him how she has purposely blinded him. He goes to his camp, and tells the assembled leaders that he has betrayed them. They ostracize him from the tribe, and plan to get back the contract they have been deluded into signing. They approach Jennings' house, and find his little daughter playing in the forest nearby. They kidnap the child, and make off with her, meanwhile dispatching an Indian message to the white man to tell him what they are doing. The spirit of revenge now conquers Brain, and he decides that he must make the girl pay for her crime against him. He comes upon her one day as she is rounding a hill, captures her, and takes her off to a mountain retreat. Jennings and his followers begin a search for the baby. They overtake the Indians and parley with them. The result is that the land agreement is settled, the child is returned to her parents, and the white men start in search of Betty. Betty has been made to live in typical Indian fashion. She has her own wigwam, and she is forced to do the chores about the encampment, and submit to Indian treatment. Then Brain tells her that she is free to go when she likes, for he thinks she has worked out her penance. As Betty leaves the camp to rejoin Jennings, she looks back and sees Brain with his arms about an Indian maiden.",,"tt0008459",,,"movie"

Elaine Bernard, one of his pupils, is cowering over a table, her hair disheveled and her clothes all but torn off her back. Ford Maillard, her fiancé, stands over her, upbraiding her bitterly, while lying prone on the ground, his face covered with blood, is Delna, a Hindoo art student, who possesses occult powers. In the background is a woman whom he does not recognize. It develops later that she is his wife whom he had not seen since his imprisonment, and that the girl is his own daughter. Maillard had arrived at the studio in time to rescue her from the attack of Delna, but, misunderstanding her presence there, accused her unjustly. Mayne recognizes in this misunderstanding a counterpart of the situation that led to his own unhappiness, and out of the wisdom bought by his bitter experience effects a reconciliation between the young people. Chastened by adversity the older couple, too, decide to start over again, and happiness results from what seemed to be at first, unrelieved misfortune.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MzE2ODQwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTc5Mjg5._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0176852",,,"movie"

His affection for Donald, his nephew, was entirely misplaced, and that unworthy young man laughed at his uncle every time he got a check from him, and proceeded to spend it upon riotous living. Christmas came, and with it Donald, who immediately proceeded to call his club friends around him and have a good time. Jim naturally was hurt, but excused Donald on the ground that youth seeks youth. But when he discovered his nephew and a group of his friends bear-baiting a poor beggar even his faith got a shock, but he took the derelict home and into his household and his heart. The next day the three friends introduced Jim to Mary, an admirable woman, and a year from that date saw them married. When Donald came home for Christmas a situation arose which was fraught with great danger, for Donald had previously been engaged to Mary, and had been low enough to permit an action of his toward her to be sadly misconstrued, destroying her reputation. In an endeavor to compromise her again the ingrate brought about two events which came near to wrecking Donald's life, but the old derelict saved the situation and exposed Donald for what he was.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA4NjQ5MTIwMTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDM0ODE4OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0007695",,,"movie"

Ain't you proud?" and while taking breakfast to Philip, the new boarder, who came from that distant place, she gazes at him as if he has come from an unknown land. Returning to the city with a newfound love and regained health, Philip struggles to sell his poems to bring his "egg" girl to her New York. In the meantime, Phoebe's brown hen proves to be a golden one, and her egg money buys a ticket to Philip and her Wonderland. On the train, Laura, a flashily-dressed woman, meets Phoebe and, tempting her with a nice new dress, takes her to her house. There, Owen, a former employer of Philip, is fascinated by her simplicity. Such grandeur and strange "fizzy" drinks overwhelm her, but Providence intervenes, when the little brown hen hops into the street with Phoebe scrambling after. A big-hearted policeman finds her and takes her to Philip, and acts as "bridesmaid" at their wedding. Their little home, built on much love and little food, is brightened by the adoption of Johnny, an abandoned baby, that Philip finds on the dumbwaiter. Johnny brings good luck and Philip secures a good job through Owen and in nicer quarters their cup of happiness seems to be full, when Owen, to further his ends, contrives to get Philip to gamble with borrowed money. Phoebe, convinced by trickery, that Philip is unfaithful, is heart-broken and believes that love and her New York are unreal after all. But, the yielding, grief-stricken country girl awakens Owen's better self, and with his help the unhappy household is reunited.",,"tt0175724",,,"movie"

Glutz provides that his bashful nephew, Hank, will inherit the entire estate if married by 2 P.M. of a certain date. Hank loves a girl who lives fifty miles away, but his uncle's executor, a lawyer, arranges a marriage with a somewhat antiquated home product. At 1 P.M. on the appointed day, Hank is sleeping off the effects of the night before. He wakens with a fever, a raging thirst, and an awful taste, when the lawyer enters and tells him the bride is waiting. ""And my heart is fifty miles away," sadly muses Hank. At the home of the bride-to-be all is ready and everyone present except the prospective groom. If Hank does not arrive in fifteen minutes, the estate will go to endow a home for aged chauffeurs. The door opens. Hank and the lawyer arrive, the clergyman is ready, when Hank exclaims, "Oh pshaw, I've forgotten the license." Hank and the lawyer start for the city hall. The chief clerk, who is deaf, is tuning an organ. He demands two dollars for the license. Hank goes out, and finally gets the money by setting fire to a saloon, and returns at 1:57 P.M. He finds the clerk has gone to lunch, and the door is locked; Hank removes the door, gets the license and starts for the bride's home, but meets a beautiful woman in the park, and tears up the license. The prospective father-in-law comes along, takes Hank by the neck and shakes him. Hank escapes in abbreviated raiment, and with father-in-law in pursuit, joins a party of marathon runners. He is soon in the lead, passing a flock of birds, and an automobile going 120 miles an hour. He romps over the 50 mile course, tears under the wire, right into the arms of the girl he loves; and wins the girl, the prize, and a loving cup.",,"tt0007785",,,"movie"

The pictures have been taken in the vicinity of Tillamook Rock Lighthouse, a landmark on the coast about fifteen miles south of where the Columbia River runs into the ocean. Among the beautiful pictures so characteristic of the coast are views of the giant step stones at Chapman's Point, Lost Cave at Ecola Point, the Needles, an interesting rock formation; Tillamook Rock, rising 80 feet above the sea; Arch Cape, Castle Rock, Hug Point, Camel Rock and Haystack Rock. The names themselves are descriptive of the shapes into which wind, water and weather have carved the coast during countless ages. Pretty summer cottages nestle among the pines along the shore above the beach, the woods are traversed by many trails, and strong winds have twisted the pine trees into grotesque shapes. Tillamook Rock, several miles at sea, is so rugged that not even a small boat can land there. There are attractive pictures of sunlight ripples on the water just before a storm, the breakers at Arch Cape, and the old iron cannon washed ashore with the wreckage of the U.S.S. Shark, which was broken up here by the waves in 1846.",,"tt4142588",,,"movie"

Isham","Edith Storey, Antonio Moreno, William Duncan, Otto Lederer","James Fitzgerald, an antiquarian, receives a letter from England that he has fallen heir to the title and fortune of his deceased brother. He leaves his Armenian wife and daughter in the care of Abu, a servant. An uprising among the Turks ensues and Mrs. Fitzgerald and the child are taken captive. Returning, Fitzgerald, with Abu, the servant, goes in pursuit. The only thing remaining of his home and wife is a small prayer book. Fitzgerald goes to Mecca to avoid capture, and hides the prayer book in a recess in the wall. Several years pass. Jack Stanton hears Lord Fitzgerald exclaim that it is impossible for any white man to emulate the feat that he did years ago. Stanton claims that if an Englishman could enter Mecca, an American could to it too. A bet is made whereby Stanton is to go to Mecca and, unaided, bring back the prayer book hidden by Fitzgerald. Stanton arrives at Mecca, disguised as a pilgrim. His father was the American Consul at Damascus in Stanton's youth, and his knowledge of Arabic is good. He finds the prayer book, but an Arab named Sadi steals it during the night. Stanton follows Sadi to Damascus. In Damascus Fitzgerald's daughter is living in the care of a presumed stepmother named ""Light of Life," who contracts with Amad, a rich diamond merchant, to deliver Faimeh, as she is called, to him as his wife. The marriage takes place in spite of Faimeh's protestations. Amad utters the triple Moslem sentence of divorce, and she is again free. Amad is still desirous of having her, but under the Koranic law, cannot remarry her until she has been married to another man and divorced by him. With El Sabbagh he goes to find a man. They find Stanton, and he is inveigled to do as they ask. Through the lattice work Stanton and Faimeh are married, but Stanton gets a glimpse of her face and refuses to pronounce the triple divorce. A fight ensues and Stanton finds himself with his wife in a walled garden. They make their escape into the desert. There Stanton disguises Faimeh as a boy and himself as a Jewish story teller. Amad and El Sabbagh in pursuit, with Sadi, who has the prayer book in his possession, overtakes them but do not recognize them. A suspicion enters Sadi's mind and he returns and spies on them. Stanton discovers him and a fight ensues in which Sadi is knocked unconscious and Stanton recovers the prayer book. Stanton and Faimeh leave on Sadi's camel and meet Fitzgerald, who is on his way to Damascus. Fitzgerald takes Faimeh with him, but Stanton goes on alone, as the agreement in the wager is that he shall not accept assistance from any Christian. Amad and El Sabbagh find Sadi, who tells them about Stanton and the girl. They start in pursuit, and during a sandstorm Amad is separated from his companions. Stanton has taken refuge behind his camel and Amad stumbles upon him and crawls under the same blanket that is protecting Stanton. The storm abates. Amad tries to kill Stanton, who finally gets the upper hand, and when he has Amad in his power his pity for the older man grows and he finally compels him to get on his camel, divides the water and tells him to be on his way before he changes his mind. In Damascus, Fitzgerald, through the jewels Faimeh wears, discovers that she is his daughter. Faimeh and Fitzgerald search for Stanton and meet Amad, who tells them about his self-sacrifice. Days later a sun-blistered man, almost out of his mind, staggers into Fitzgerald's apartment. There he sees Fitzgerald and Faimeh in an attitude of endearment and taking a mistaken idea from it, utters the triple divorce and then falls in a faint. Faimeh nurses him through a long siege of brain fever, and on his recovery explains to him the reason for the occurrence that he has witnessed. After a time, back on Broadway, Fitzgerald settles his wager and a Christian marriage is performed.",,"tt0007618",,,"movie"

His father loses a large amount of money because the youth forgets to deliver bonds entrusted to him. Bill quarrels with Ethel Manton, the girl he loves, and he makes up his mind to leave home and ""make good" in his own way. Mistaking the bonds for a package of Ethel's letters, he puts them into his pocket and takes them with him. On the way west Bill meets D.S. Appleton, a lumber baron. The train is wrecked, and Bill, having saved Appleton's life, is taken from the wreckage unconscious and hurried to the Appleton home. Bill tells Appleton that he is looking for work, but refuses to reveal his identity. Appleton sends Bill to Buck Moncrossen's camp, believing the boy is made of the right stuff, and that the stern discipline of Moncrossen's place will bring it out. A clash of wills between Bill and Moncrossen takes place, and the big lumberman proves to have a cowardly streak in him. His hatred for Bill grows. Meantime Ethel has accepted the invitation of St. Ledger, a fortune hunter, to join his party on a cruise to Palm Beach. Ethel is accompanied by her aunt and brother, Charlie, who, loyal to Bill, loses no opportunity to balk St. Ledger's attentions to Ethel. Finally tiring of the fortune hunter, Ethel persuades her aunt to accept the invitation of Appleton to come north and inspect his lumber holdings. Moncrossen has taken a fancy to Jeanne, an Indian girl. Bill has protected her from Moncrossen, and the lumberman plans to be revenged. During the spring drive, when the logs are taken down to the mills, Bill almost loses his life when a log jam is dynamited. Hurled into the river, and believed by Moncrossen to have been drowned, he is rescued by Jeanne and taken to her tepee. While he is recovering Jeanne falls in love with him, and makes him promise that if Moncrossen ever tries to molest her again, he will come to her assistance. Then he goes farther up the river, where Appleton has another camp. Ethel, on her visit to the Appleton holdings, meets Bill. Their misunderstandings grow rather than lessen, and just when Ethel begins to realize the change that has come about in Bill, Jeanne comes into camp, telling him that Moncrossen is threatening her. Without explaining to Ethel, he goes away with Jeanne. Ethel, brokenhearted, is about to leave camp and return home, when Fallon, a friend of Bill's, tells her of the promise Bill has made to Jeanne. Moncrossen has imprisoned Jeanne's old grandmother. Bill goes to force Moncrossen to release her, and a fight, almost to the death, follows, in which the big bully's spirit is utterly broken, Bill being the victor. Jeanne wants to go to Bill after the contest is over, but her wise old grandmother will not permit it, saying that it is a divine law that the red shall not mix with the white. A complete reconciliation between Ethel and Bill follows. The father having learned the truth about the disappearance of the bonds, comes to express his joy in the regeneration of his son.",,"tt0008468",,,"movie"

A miner who has been fleeced of his money in the gaming hall after Haney sells out shoots Haney. Bertha and Haney are married, and she nurses him back to health, though he remains badly crippled. They move to Colorado Springs, and buy a magnificent home. Later Bertha meets Ben Fordyce, an honorable young man, engaged to Alice Heath, a consumptive. Haney and his wife go east at the same time that Ben takes his affianced wife back. The four travel on the same train, and during the trip Ben and Bertha become more attached to each other. Both, however, remain loyal to their trusting ones. In the east Bertha's longing for Ben becomes almost unbearable. Her husband, noting her morose condition and being apprised of the cause of it by Alice just before she dies, suggests to his wife that they return to their home in Colorado Springs. So that he might bring happiness to the two young lovers, Haney whose heart is weak, deliberately climbs a mountain.

Unknown to her husband, her mother, Mrs. Brunschaut, has involved her in a foreign conspiracy, in order that she may add to the extravagance of her living. David Angelo becomes aware of the intrigue, but before he can discover just what it is, he is called to Naples on business. He leaves his fortune in care of his partner, Stroggi, to be given to Mrs. Angelo in case anything happens to him. On his trip back home he stops to see Vesuvius, and is caught by a sudden eruption and smothered under the hot ashes. He is, however, rescued, and under the treatment of a great scientist, is restored to health; his physical disabilities have also been removed, and he is straight and rejuvenated in appearance, so much so that the doctor tells him he would not be believed if he declared himself to be David Angelo, and he decides to let the world believe that he is dead. He returns to Rome and startles the national treasurer by his brilliant suggestions in connection with finance, spies on the conspirators who are seeking to compromise his wife, is introduced in his own home without being recognized, and prevents his wife's fortune being stolen by his former partner. He also wins his wife's love, and, upon consenting to marry him, she rejoices to learn that he is really the supposedly dead David Angelo.",,"tt0008263",,,"movie"

Vic and his wife are annoyed after the boat starts by the prying eyes of the two detectives. The stewards tell the detectives that they saw the jewelry taken from the Holsteins in Vic's room. They determine to arrest them that night. But seasickness prevents them and raises havoc with Vic and his bride. The next morning Vic and his wife are arrested in the presence of the passengers in the salon.

Rose loses no time in forcing her rather gay husband to sign and Helen finds it an easy matter to obtain the signature of her sweetheart, Jim. Unfortunately, Mr. Love is met by a number of old friends who insist upon him taking a drink before he goes home, in spite of the pledge, which they ridicule. He falls off the water-wagon and is soon in no condition to dine at home; he, therefore, phones his wife that he is obliged to work late. Jim, who really has to work, also phones that he cannot come. Helen thinks he is not telling the truth and a lonely evening is passed by both women. In the meantime Harry ends up the night by dining in a cabaret, and when it is time to leave he can hardly stagger. In a rather helpless condition he is found leaning against a post by Jim, who, having finished his work, is returning home. Jim consents to help Harry home. Harry insists upon being taken in through the kitchen, where he knocks over a table. The noise awakens Rose and her sister, who immediately think of burglars. Rose dons her husband's clothes and, with a pistol, the women go downstairs to face the burglar. Jim sees Helen with a man's arms around her and denounces her. Rose denounces Jim for having brought her husband home in such a condition. The next morning Harry explains that Jim had not been drinking but had met him and brought him home. Helen decides to ask Jim's forgiveness, and is informed over the phone that within ten minutes he will be a dead man. Helen, Rose and Harry rush to save Jim. When they arrive at his home they And him lying on the floor with a gas pipe in his mouth. They think that he is dead and while Helen is bending over him Jim rises and kisses her. He was only playing dead, and the pipe he had in his mouth was found to be attached to a water faucet.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BZGY3MTRjNzEtYmNhNy00OTgyLWEwNjMtODZjZmI5YzgwZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt4427354",,,"movie"

The ship also brought back a native. "English Walnuts in the United States" takes the spectator to a large California grove.

"Making Bottles at Home" shows how the dairyman may purchase pasteboard blanks which can be shaped into the form of a bottle.

These are "Picturesque Landscapes of Holland," "The Temples of Luxor, Egypt," and "The Rocky Coast of Dalmatia." The Holland views are not of any particular locality, the editor of the reel preferring to show characteristic scenes that typify the entire country. There are pictures of houses built on piles, for fear the sea will break through the dikes, windmills with great canvas wings, meadow lands where sheep graze, canals laden with water craft, and peasants in their native garb. One-fourth of Holland is below sea level. These pictures supplement pictures of Amsterdam shown in "Tours Around the World," No. 3. "The Temples of Luxor" afford glimpses of a vanished civilization that is still giving up its secrets as the shifting sands of the desert disclose monuments of the past. Biblical students will appreciate these pictures of the grandeur of Egypt fourteen centuries before the birth of Christ. The temple of Medinet-Habu is shown from several points of vantage, even the inscriptions upon the walls being pictured. There are also pictures of the Temple of Stehos I, the Temple of Deirel-Bahri, and statues of Rameses II and Memnon. Now that the Allies have promised Dalmatia to Italy, this dependency of Austria comes into prominence in the world's news. Answering the demand made upon it for information, the Gaumont Company now puts out pictures of Dalmatian rocky coast with a panorama of the port of Gravosa.",,"tt4239000",,,"movie"

Mary had always been ""straight" in spite of her association with Moran and his band of blackmailers. But she had erred against man-made laws, though innocently, and fearing disgrace and prison if exposed by Moran she was compelled to assist in his nefarious schemes. Moran discovered that Ingalls loved children, and that he lived a secluded, lonely life. Mary's advent in John Ingalls' life was for the purpose of introducing a supposed little sister of hers into the Ingalls' home and through this child, thoroughly trained for the task assigned her, ultimately reach Ingalls' store of wealth. Moran's plans were successful until Mary began to realize she loved Ingalls and rebelled against further deception. Ingalls loved Mary and offered her his hand. The wedding ceremony was simple but pretty. Meanwhile, Moran had been planning along different lines. Why not force Mary to get a large sum from her husband and leave with him for foreign shores? Moran has long coveted Mary and he believes this his opportunity. Mary, for once in her bitter life, enjoys the utmost happiness. This joy is increased by the realization that she is soon to become a mother. Time has flown backward ten years in the life of John Ingalls. He feels the blood of young manhood coursing through his veins. Soon Moran presents his plan to Mary, who pleads with Moran to have pity and leave her in peace; but there is no alternative, she must go or see herself and husband disgraced by Moran's exposure. At home, Mary ponders long over her duty. She looks out on the placid lake from her window and with a prayer to the "God of Little Children," decides to give up the struggle and end her life, Moran, meanwhile, has plotted carefully. For a few dollars "Hard Tack," his willing accomplice, will put John Ingalls out of the way. The public will believe he committed suicide because his wife deserted him. The note she writes upon leaving will be found beside the body. Then with John Ingalls' widow in his power nothing shall come between Robert Moran and a fortune. Seated in his library, John Ingalls little dreamed that the hand of an assassin was near. Beside the lake Mary is about to end her life. She looks up at the library window with a silent prayer to Ingalls not to misjudge when she sees a crouching figure holding a pistol, silhouetted against the blind. Mary rushes into the house and reaches his side just in time to divert the bullet from Hard Tack's weapon. Ingalls conquers Hard Tack, who is hurled through a window. He is killed by his fall. Moran, waiting outside for Mary to meet him according to promise, overhears the pistol shot and, becoming alarmed at Hard Tack's long absence, boldly comes into the library, revolver in hand. Mary, seeing Moran and believing Ingalls' life again in danger, takes aim with the gun she picks up and fires at Moran. He falls dead, the bullet piercing his heart. The story ends happily.",,"tt0175673",,,"movie"

The president received a letter from a friend notifying him there is oil in the town of Glory. He forms a dummy railroad company and sends a representative to Glory to get rights to the property by promising that the dummy company will establish a station at Glory. While getting the rights to the property, the oil representative goes through what he supposes a fake marriage with the postmistress of the village. Time passes and the postmistress leaves the village for a neighboring town, where she gives birth to a child. Unable to support the child, she brings the baby to the village hotel run by two Germans, and, under cover of darkness, leaves the baby there. The baby is adopted by the village, named Glory Glory, and brought up by the two Germans. In the meantime the mother has made her way to the city and drops from exhaustion in front of the president of the oil company's house, when she is picked up and carried in. Upon examination by the doctor he finds the fall has caused her to lose her memory. The president is a widower and upon the woman's recovery decides to have her stay as governess and bring up his young son. Several years pass by and both Glory and the president's son are grown up. They accidentally meet and fall in love. The oil company decides to take possession of the property at Glory and then a fight ensues, the son taking sides with the girl he loves and her people. During the lapse of years the man who put through the original deal for the oil company and who married the postmistress has risen to be a judge. The case is brought before him and he dismissed the charges of the citizens of Glory. The son decides to assist and steals the papers relative to the case. The judge and president of the company finally decide to make restitution. The marriage is found to be legal. The people get the oil property back, and Glory is happy with her sweetheart.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODRlODkzYWUtMWE1Ni00ZTE5LWJjZTctMjliYTAyNDEwNjIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008015",,,"movie"

As she helps Silver from his buggy a pouch falls, spilling some of its gold pieces. The money is seen by Jose, the vaquero and by Raghun, the Hindoo cook. An hour later Silver returns to the house to get his bag of gold. He does not reappear and upon investigating it is found that he has been murdered. Near the body is Jose's kerchief. Jose has ridden away and the punchers start in pursuit of him. Barbara finds the prints of sandals on the wet floor. Brent and Wallace search the Hindoo quarters and Barbara follows the footprints outside the window through which the murderer has entered. She finds Raghun rifling his shack. He locks her in, then departs. Breaking the window, Barbara follows him on horseback. Raghun shoots her and in falling she rolls over a cliff but only slightly wounded, finally overtakes him and returns to the ranch with her prisoner. She is just in time to save Jose's life whose confession showed that he had been sent on an errand by the Raghun who placed Jose's kerchief by the body of Silver.",,"tt0829319",,,"movie"

Burns","Bert Morgan and ""Squint" Booth are freight agents for rival railroads concerned in getting the contract for hauling the gold ore produced by the Mogul Mountain mine. The contract finally falls to the road employing Morgan upon his promise to have cars in operation over an abandoned spur track within three weeks' time. "Squint" learns that there is a law on the statute books which says that a railroad's right of way reverts to the owner of the adjoining property if no trains are run over the rails within five years. He purchases the adjoining farms but falls under the suspicion of Helen, the telegraph operator at Lone Point. Helen telegraphs her suspicions to the division superintendent who looks up the law and determines to send a special train over the abandoned spur track before four o'clock of the same day that the five-year period would expire. "Squint" has left one of his lieutenants on guard at the mine to watch developments. Learning that the "special" has started and realizing that he must prevent its completing the trip at any cost, he forces Helen, on duty, to stand by while he telephones his aide to release the brakes on an empty car at the mine. As "Squint" and his confederates rush out of the station Helen runs down the track towards the onrushing runaway car. In her desperation she can only think of one thing to do and Fate wills that a lineman repairing the telegraph wires shall be the one to aid her. Proceeding a bit further up the track she orders the lineman to climb a pole and to lock his legs around the cross arm in such a manner that his hands and arms are free. Helen then climbs to the top of the pole and as the runaway car, bearing a box of dynamite that "Squint" has placed in it, rounds the curve she reaches up her arms for the lineman to grasp. With the pole swaying beneath its extra weight, the lineman takes a firm grip on Helen's wrists and swings her out over the track and drops on to the runaway car as it passes. In a few minutes she has recovered her breath and is tugging at the brake wheel. She stops the runaway within inches of the oncoming special, thereby earning the gratitude of both Morgan and the division superintendent.",,"tt1570710",,,"movie"

It is certain that the close of the war will see a general exodus of sight-seeing Americans to the sister republic. With this in mind the Gaumont Company has filmed for American spectators some of the sights which will be seen on a tour of France, aside from pictures of devastation in the war zone. The first series of pictures in Gaumont's ""Tours Around the World" No. 12 shows Bordeaux. France, and sights along the river down to Pauillac, near the coast, noted for its wines. Although the fourth port of France, Bordeaux is situated 60 miles inland on the Gironde River. A beautiful picture is of the Place des Quinconces, one of the city's principal promenades. Another is the monument in honor of the Girondists. The city's importance depending upon the sea, there is a comprehensive view of the quays. The Monastery of St. Thessalonica, located Just outside Salonika, now in the hands of the Allies, is typical of monastery life in that part of Greece which recently was redeemed from Turkish rule. The pictures show in detail the manner of living of the men who have turned their backs on man the better to glorify God in the mountain country. The monasteries derive their income principally from the raising of olives and the breeding of pigs. A third section of the reels brings to view some remarkable views of the gorges of the Nive River in the French Pyrenees.",,"tt4238992",,,"movie"

Two private detectives connect him with the crime. Later, the members of the protected organization to which the man belonged, attempt to kill Chuck, but he kills three of them and the detectives help him make a getaway. They then force Chuck with threats of the electric chair to kill a reformer who has been upsetting the organization. Chuck then becomes a regular member of the gang. Chuck falls in love with Annie Mangan, who is persuaded to go to the Salvation Army home. Chuck comes to the dancehall looking for her and is told that she has joined the Salvation Army. The new District Attorney is pounding the graft organizations. Word is passed to the gunmen to get him. Chuck goes to the District Attorney's house to threaten him, and is taken aback when the District Attorney's three-year-old daughter leans trustfully on his knee and looks up into his face with a smile. He goes to the Salvation Army for another sight of Annie. Chuck's sister has become the mistress of Jim Canford, the man higher up. The District Attorney pays no attention to the warning. Chuck is ordered to kill him and breaks into the house. He sees the District Attorney's little daughter, who forgot one of her dolls and is on her way to the library to get it. He steps out of sight, the child passes him, and he attempts to go up the stairs but cannot do it. Canford arranges to put some other man on the job and accuse Chuck. His sister overhears and warns Chuck, who has gone to the Salvation Army. He tells Annie he has thrown the gang down and asks her to teach him ""this religion thing." She explains, but he cannot understand how a few words of acknowledgment can square all he has done. His sister arrives and, seeing a chance "to square himself with God," goes to save the District Attorney. The gunmen have surrounded the District Attorney's house before Chuck arrives. He reaches the door and sees the gunmen. There is no time to wait, so he breaks through the library window, grabs the District Attorney and his daughter, hurries them up stairs and faces the gunmen. The District Attorney's life is saved, but Chuck is mortally wounded. Word is sent to Annie and his sister and they come to the house. Chuck dies, feeling that this was the only way in which he could atone.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BZjdlODlkN2YtM2FmZC00Y2Y5LWExYTMtN2RkYjU5ZWJlMjJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt0008664",,,"movie"

The principal character is a girl nicknamed "Rags" by her associates in the dives and haunts of night life. A leading producer is anxious to have the book dramatized and his leading woman, Mavis Marberrv, insists on her right to create the part of "Rags." Hale accedes to the manager's request, but rejects Mavis for the part, as he believes her talent is exclusively of the refined comedy order. With the aid of a dramatic critic Mavis stages a surprise for the author and is introduced as "Chicken Casey," a typical "Rags," in a low Bowery dive. She enacts the part so well that Hale, unaware that she is a famous actress, starts to reclaim her and informs the manager that he has found his ideal heroine and "Chicken Casey" must have the star role. The play is a success. Mavis playing the part of "Rags" with the same realism with which she invested the mock creation "Chicken Casey." Hale recognizes that he has been the victim of a trick, leaves the theater hurt and indignant.

Slim, jealous because of Louise, decides to show the preacher as being yellow and shows up at the revival but backs up when he sees that the parson is preaching with his two guns before him. Slim writes a letter appearing to be from an acquaintance of the parson saying his disguise is fine and they should use it on their next job. Slim slips the note on the parson's coat but Louise sees him do it and tells the parson. Slim goes to the Sheriff and says the parson is just a low-life outlaw and there is a letter of proof in his coat.

Vic embraces her and announces that ten o'clock that night will be the hour for the happy event. Jim Norton, who is also a suitor for Doris' hand, starts out to try to prevent Doris' marriage to Vic. Vic and Doris go to get their marriage license, and then Vic goes home to prepare for the wedding. He takes a bath, and Norton and his friend steal all of his clothes. Vic is in a dilemma until his friend, Bill Morris, who is dressed in his evening clothes, calls. Vic pleads with him to lend him his dress clothes, as it is then ten o'clock. Morris agrees, and though much too small for Vic, he manages to squeeze into them. He leaves his friend dressed in a bathrobe. He runs for a car and drops his hat near a traffic signal and tries to pick it up; but as the trousers are too tight he finds it impossible to do so. Holding on to the traffic signal, and balancing himself, he finally gets the hat. Norton, who has followed, handcuffs him to the traffic signal, so when Vic gets up and starts to leave he has to take the traffic signal with him. He arrives at a thoroughfare and works the ""stop and go" signal. One machine stops, and the occupant agrees to help him, so Vic gets into the motor car. Norton has also secured a marriage license, and tells Doris Vic is handcuffed, and the key which he exhibits is the only one which will open the handcuffs. He drops the key in a mail box, and Doris tries to get it. One of her rings gets caught, and it is impossible to get her hand free. It is now a quarter to twelve, and Norton offers to marry her, but she refuses. Vic, with the traffic sign, comes up in the motor car and sends for the minister who happens to be tongue-tied, and who manages to get them married before the necessary hour.

An experienced operator demonstrates how to fit the apparatus over the mouth of the victim, and also how to furnish ""first aid" until the pulmotor arrives. A second section of this reel makes the spectator acquainted with the Indian method of weaving the deservedly famous Navajo blankets. The pictures were taken in Arizona and show the various processes followed by the squaws in completing their work. A number of ceremonial blankets are also pictured. A sight familiar to all New Yorkers is the clock which is the crowning ornament of the Herald Building at Herald Square. It is unique not only because of its interesting composition as a work of art, but also because the two figures on either side the bell strike the hours with their heavy hammers. The picture was taken just as these heroic bronze figures are beating the hours. Swedish gymnastics are so much a part of the athletic life of that nation that their inclusion in this issue will bring to American spectators pictures of physical preparedness that all should seek to emulate. The pictures show some of the work of a class highly developed, although some of the exercises are elemental. The reel concludes with entertaining views of winter sports in Florida, aquaplaning, aeroplaning and motorboating.",,"tt4239044",,,"movie"

The Pyrenees are extremely picturesque. There are deep gorges not more than eight or ten feet wide, dashing cataracts, and rugged valleys. Especially pleasing is the picture of the Hourat gorges, through which rushes the Ossau River. Then at Laruns the Ossau comes out of its troubled mountain bed to become a peaceful river. Budapest, situated on both banks of the Danube River, is the largest city of the Kingdom of Hungary. In addition to a general view of the city there is a picture of the celebrated Elizabeth Suspension bridge, a good view of the river boats, and pictures of the houses of Parliament. Life in Egypt pictures the Procession of the Sacred Carpet, taken every year to Mecca and returned to its Mosque at Cairo with stately ceremonies, the Khedive taking part. Other pictures show native soldiers, women transporting water from the Nile, an Arabian café, an Egyptian market place, and the primitive methods of agriculture and irrigation still practiced.",,"tt4162758",,,"movie"

These towns give an excellent idea of life in the state which is so hospitably southern and historically interesting. At Pass Christian are pictured the home of John M. Parker, Progressive candidate for Vice-President last year, the beautiful Beach Shell Road along the coast, and the Herndon cottage which is occupied by President Wilson when he winters in the south. Gulfport offers views of its beautiful resort hotel, its country club, and thousands of feet of yellow pine, for Gulfport is one of the largest shipping points in the world for this lumber. Beauvoir is notable for its echoes of the Confederacy. First in importance in the pictures is the home of Jefferson Davis. Hither he retired after the war to write the history of the Lost Cause. There is also a Confederate Soldiers' Home. Biloxi is commercially the most important town on the Mississippi coast.

The letter blows out the window and against the face of the superintendent. He notes its contents and then it blows away again.

Through a misunderstanding, she thinks she has been deserted by her lover when he goes west and leaves her and her baby in the east, to fight out the questions of life in their own unaided way. Disconsolate, heartbroken, she drifts westward herself, and meets Watt Tabor in a rough frontier village. To provide for her child, she is forced into theft, but is detected. Tabor, who knows her history, shoulders the blame himself and marries her. She despises him because she thinks he married her as the result of a whim, and not as the result of real love. Then she meets again the man who first wronged her. Mallaby demands that Tabor give up the woman. Tabor refuses. His decision results in a battle between the two. In the darkness and surging water of a mine, they wage their last fight. Mallaby loses consciousness, but Tabor rescues him, and leaves Mary free to make her choice.

Here they meet Mike Hernandez, a good-looking bad man. Mary, thinking Mike a gentleman, takes a liking to him. "Cheyenne" Harry, a homely looking good man, comes to Jawbone and Mary believes him to be a weak character. He becomes fascinated with her. Gregg hires Mike Hernandez to guide him to Burro Springs, displaying his small store of gold when paying Hernandez. Later, Gregg and his party become lost in the desert, and run out of water. Mike finds a spring of poisoned water. He removes the sign guarding persons away, allowing Gregg to drink. He dies, and Mike robs him of his gold. Harry, knowing Mike's evil nature, goes in search of Mary and her father and finds them near the spring. Mary believes that Harry has robbed her father, but realizing that rescue from the desert depends upon him, she remains silent. Harry guides Mike and Mary to Burro Springs, where he leaves them. Penniless, Mary is induced by Mike to enter Murphy's place as a dance-girl. On her first night in the place, she is insulted by a drunken cowboy. Harry, returning to Burro Springs, arrives at the dance hall in time to stop the insult. Mike, knowing that he can do little with Mary as long as Harry is around, starts a fight. Harry whips a number of the men, and holds the crowd at bay with his guns. Mike, half drunk, goes upstairs, where he attacks Mary. Harry, holding the crowd at bay, backs up the stairs and unintentionally backs into Mary's room where she is struggling with Mike. He kills Mike. The crowd threaten Harry, but he manages to quiet all by taking the gold from Mike's pocket and explaining the situation. Mary realizes that appearances are deceptive.",,"tt0008582",,,"movie"

The Normandy resorts are frequented, not only by the French, but by all other nations, when war does not give them over to the military, the huge hotels turned into hospitals. Etretat sprang into popularity because of its frequent mention in the novels of Alphonse Karr. Honfleur dates from the eleventh century. Its inhabitants live chiefly upon the fishing industry. Trouville is the most frequented and perhaps the most fashionable French resort on the English Channel. The pictures in the Vosges Mountains were taken at Gerardmer.

The younger man suddenly rises from his hard bench. Turning to his companions he cries out, ""I am through with this life: I am going back to America and decency. Come, go with me." But the other two pay no attention to his words and he leaves alone. After a hard struggle drowning a fierce desire for the drug by an over-indulgence in drink, he arrives in Cincinnati. He stumbles into a mission house and there comes to him the resolve to give up forever all drink. Unable to recall his name or anything about the past, he registers as John Smith. Realizing the havoc that "demon rum" makes of hearts and homes, John Smith devotes his life to the prohibition cause. He soon becomes a force in political affairs. Among those most interested in seeing the liquor interests win out is Senator Mallon of Ohio, who has been elected by the Whiskey Trust. Mallon's daughter, Edith, is attracted by John Smith, and she sympathizes with his fight for the right. He, in turn, is won over by her charm and he longs to declare his love, but always present with him is that doubt as to his past life, who he is and where he came from. The whiskey men finally decide to crush Smith socially. Mallon writes him a note stating that he and his daughter desire that all social relationship between them be discontinued. Smith only laughs at the note. Smith's companions in China drift to Washington. Through Simpson, the oppositions learn of Smith's life in the opium den and determine to make use of it. The woman declares that Smith is her husband and tells of incidents to prove her statement. Edith is overcome to see the man she loves claimed by this depraved creature and begs Smith to deny that this is his wife, but sadly shaking his head, he says although he doesn't remember the woman, she may be right. He may have married her in the days back of memory. The day of the great fight arrives. From all over the country comes a huge crowd summoned by Smith to plead for the prohibition cause. Through the streets of Washington they surge up the Capitol steps, into the very Senate chamber, this great army of derelicts by their very presence, an unanswerable argument against whiskey. The voters are swayed by the remarkable crowd and John Smith's fight is won. The woman, brought to a realization of the wrong she has done, rushes to Smith and confesses that she lied, that she is not his wife. She recalls to him conversation in which he told her of his mother and his early home life. Slowly Smith's memory returns, the past is recalled, and clasping Edith in his arms, he tells her that now that he can remember all; there is no longer any reason why they should remain apart.",,"tt0008255",,,"movie"

Crippled and living a lonely life in the country, while his young wife seeks the pleasures of the city, he becomes cynical. Through the request of one Red Cross service, he turns his home into a hospital for the wounded soldiers. Among them are two Frenchmen, Francas and a boy, who appear to be great friends. Francas tells Colonel Daw how his wife died when their babe was tiny and how the aged grandmother had since cared for the child. Then he recited the story told by the boy, who had tried to escape with the baby when the grandmother was killed, but while going in search of food, had lost the little one. Breaking down, Francas begs Colonel Daw to find his child and protect her. As he sits by the fire, gazing at the baby face of the picture given him, Colonel Daw falls asleep and dreams of the coming of Zoe, the lost infant. Suddenly awaking, he sees his wife leading a small girl by the hand. He immediately recognizes the little waif as the child of Francas. She had been brought from France by the nurses and was found by his wife at the station amid a lot of luggage. It is Christmas Eve. Francas has recuperated since seeing his baby. The Christmas tree is gaily decorated and Zoe distributes the presents to the soldiers and nurses, while Colonel Daw sits with his arm about his wife. Wistfully she is telling him that the child has awakened her love and that she is going to stay with him to try to make up for her past neglect.",,"tt0326386",,,"movie"

"The Swede" sweeps the streets and The Tad drives a dump cart. While talking one day the fire department runs past and they envy the fireman. They stop the political boss and ask him to set them jobs with the fire department. He tells them to stick to their jobs. During the noon-hour they sit in the rear of the dump cart and finish the contents of their lunch pails. As they sit back to enjoy a smoke, their imaginations show them as fire chiefs surrounded by husky firemen. A political friend dashes up and informs them he has started an independent fire league and wants them to take charge of it. They are delighted, and he takes them to the new fire house. They are introduced to the firemen and at once take charge. They put the firemen to work and keep everything humming. The chief orders a fire drill after which all grab the pole and slide up to their dormitory. There the firemen undress by order. The helmets all come off at one count and are thrown across on their respective pegs on another. The shoes follow and are thrown into a corner where they arrange themselves in a row. The firemen jump backward into bed and are automatically covered up. The chief and his assistant retire to their own bedrooms where they undress, and hang their clothes on a rack. In the night the fire-gong awakes the firemen, who turn to a row of push buttons. They push No. 1, and the bed clothes fly off; No. 2 and the shoes fly out of the corner on to their feet. No. 3 tips the beds and lands the firemen on the floor. On pushing No. 4 their helmets fly off the pegs and land on their heads. No. 5 lines them all up at attention. The chiefs start for the door. As they pass the clothes rack they appear on the other side fully clothed. They dash into the dormitory and all slide down the pole. The horses are quickly harnessed and all start for the fire, the chief in a dinky roadster, the others on the fire engine, while the hose cart, pulled by a dried up little fireman, speeds up and passes the engine, runs up behind the chief's auto and jumps over it. At the fire they have many difficulties and finally seeing a girl at the fourth story window with the flames shooting out around her, they lasso her and pull her to the ground. She "bawls them out" and the boys decide that their methods of rescuing are wrong. Another girl appears at an upper window. The chief orders his men to play the hose just under the window. He jumps into the stream and slides up to the window, gets the girl and prepares to slide down again when the hose breaks. With his arms around the girl, and struggling against the flames he awakes to find himself seated in the dump cart with his arms around the street sweeper. He relates his dream and finishes by saying "I don't want to be a fireman," and they start for their afternoon's work.",,"tt4161986",,,"movie"

Vic and his wife revel in tangoing and Vic also has a passion for Welsh rarebits. One night after partaking of his favorite dish, he rises from bed, picks up the alarm clock, a cane and his wife's hat, and tangos out of the room to the fire escape. On the platform below he dislodges a milk bottle and the crash awakens his wife, who hastily puts on Vic's overcoat and cap and follows down the fire escape. Casey, a bicycle cop, is astounded at the sight of the pajama clad figure of Vic reposing on the guard of an automobile drawn up at the curb, and tries various methods to awaken him. Mrs. Vic appears and explains. When all other measures have failed, she sets the alarm and the familiar sound awakens him, and he returns to his apartment swearing to cut out the festive rarebit. The next morning he finds his employer, Walter Higgins, in a state of terror. Vera Thomas, a show girl, is going to bring suit against him for breach of promise unless he marries her. She has a big bundle of his love letters to prove her contention. He promises Vic to raise his salary $5,000 a year if he obtains those letters from Vera. Vic writes to Vera that he is a wealthy westerner who has seen her performance and would like to star her in musical comedy. Vera, who is in love with Delmont, the tenor of the company, is delighted. Vic meets Vera at the stage door and proposes that they talk the matter over at her apartment. Higgins follows and hides near the house. If Vic gets the letters he is to drop them out of the window. Mrs. Vic has been notified that he will not be at home until late and has covered his pajamas with a sign reading: ""Victor Moore, sleepwalker. Return to Rex apartments, apartment 4-D." Vic is astounded to find that he lives in the same place and that his apartments are just above Vera's. Vera suggests that they have a Welsh rarebit, and Vic tries to sidestep it, but she insists. After eating he finds an excuse to send Vera from the room and locates Higgins' letters, but before he can get them, Vera reappears. He leaves and returns to his apartments, thinking Higgins has departed, but the latter is still hanging around below. Soon after Vic retires, the rarebit gets in its work, and he goes down the fire escape in his pajamas. He enters Vera's room, where she and her maid are in night robes. Vera does not recognize him and the two women watch him as he searches the cabinet. As he bends over to look into a drawer Vera and the maid see the card with his name. Mrs. Vic, who has awakened, comes down the fire escape in a kimona and motions the women to be cautious. Vic goes to the table and his hand touches a cigarette that Vera has placed there. The burn awakens Vic. Vera starts towards him. Mrs. Vic grabs her and tells her he is still asleep. Vic hears this speech and takes advantage of the opportunity to get the letters. Vera, alarmed, follows him to the window. He throws the letters to Higgins, who burns them in a vacant lot. Vic and his wife return to their apartments and Vera faints in the arms of her maid. Mrs. Vic lashes his hands and feet to the bed with his dressing gown cord and he accepts the situation as a penance for breaking his resolve not to eat Welsh rarebit.",,"tt0778093",,,"movie"

In it he finds an account of how Herr Trigger, a scientist, has discovered a powerful explosive and that several foreign nations are bidding for the secret. While he ponders over this a girl enters the office. She tells him that she is Gretchen, the daughter of Herr Trigger, and that she wants him to find her father, who has disappeared. She tells him of the discovery of the explosive, how her father's assistant tried to steal the formula, how Senor Frijoles and a Spanish girl called at the house to buy the secret on the previous day and how, the next morning, she found the laboratory wrecked and her father gone. High Spigh takes the case and Gretchen takes him to her home where he finds a clue in the shape of a huge footprint. He follows the trail down the street till he runs into the owner of the foot, a big Mexican. On seeing the detective's badge the Mex runs. He seizes a bunch of toy balloons from a street vendor and floats off into the air with them. High punctures the balloons with shots from his revolver. The Mex falls through a skylight into a room with his explosives. When the big Mex announces that the police are on their trail, the gang seize Herr Trigger and all dive through the trap in the wall, sliding through a subterranean passage to the river. Meanwhile High leaps to the top of the building, drops through the skylight and finds himself in the den. There he carelessly drops one of the bombs and is blown up into the sky. He lands in the river from which he is rescued by Gretchen whom he sends to Frijoles' office to find the missing formula if possible. Frijoles sends the gang to their cave with Herr Trigger while he and the Spanish girl go to his office. He stops to buy a cigar and she enters the office which is on the thirty-fifth floor of an office building, and finds Gretchen opening the safe. She and Gretchen have a fight with bowie knives which ends as a mouse runs across the floor and both girls jump on a desk and hug each other for safety. Frijoles enters and he and the Spanish girl lock Gretchen in the safe and push it out the window. High Spigh enters just in time to see this. He turns and runs down the thirty-five flights of stairs and reaches the grounds in time to catch the safe as it lands. Releasing Gretchen, he sends her home and trails Frijoles, who orders a barrel of powder sent to the den. High hides in the barrel and arrives at the den. Frijoles and the Spanish girl capture Gretchen and take her to the den where they tie her and her father, set a fuse to the barrel of powder and leave them to their fate. Gretchen gets free, pushes the barrel down the mountain where it chases the gang up a tree. High comes out of the barrel and covers the gang with his gun. They try to resist and he shoots. A dissolve shows him at his desk, having dreamed of all this. His feet are on the desk in front of him, his gun in his hand. As he pulls the trigger he shoots his own toe, wakes up, and dances around the room holding his foot.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0M2QxZWQtNjMxZC00ZmFmLWE4YWEtNDFjZGZlMDFiNGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","tt4239060",,,"movie"

The process is not complicated, yet eighteen months elapse from the time the water is pumped into the vats until the refined salt is ready for market. The Hawaiian wave of ukulele music and hula hula dancing has not abated with the coming of cold weather, and nightly from coast to coast theaters and cabarets vie with each other in presenting these beautiful dancers of the South Seas to the strains of the sensuous music of the Pacific Isles.

He receives word that the ship upon which his loved ones have taken passage has been lost at sea. So the doll becomes a greater part of his life than hitherto. At night in his dreams it seems to come to life and speaks to him. Some time later he receives word from his sister asking him to return to the old home across the seas. He has saved up a little money but not enough for his passage. Seeing the advertisement of a mine promoter, he seeks him out and to him commits his savings. While at the promoter's office he sees Henry's wife and child. Henry absconds with the money, leaving his child ill. The child begs for the doll which the toymaker has refused to sell. The doctor thinks that if she can have her wish granted it may lead to her recovery. The mother goes to the toymaker's shop. The toymaker turns her away. That night the doll becomes the living child in his dreams, but accuses him of being selfish. The toymaker takes the doll to the child.

He has won his position by merciless grinding and is regarded by the villagers with fear and contempt. A stern man, with only one softening influence in his life, his wife, whom he idolizes. The wife dies and Borrum turns on the world with added bitterness and hatred. He is living a life of dreary isolation when one day a visitor steps off the train at the station, a little girl; also alone in the world; who has been tagged to her destination in the search of a relative who has long since disappeared. The villagers are too poor to adopt the child. In a cynical mood Borrum takes possession of the girl. Ivy Marten, and installs her in his home. Ivy, aching for sympathy, meets with no response from the austere man, whose treatment of her borders on brutality. Exaggerated reports of this reach the authorities, and Borrum is haled before them. Ivy, who loves the old man in spite of his coldness, is the prime witness for the defense and her loyal support of her guardian wins the day. A change comes over the attitude of Borrum towards the child and the world in general and with a softened heart he strives to make life happier for the orphan and for the hitherto despised inhabitants of the poverty stricken village.",,"tt0168613",,,"movie"

Helen, the operator at Lone Point, in answering Grace's questions about her rescuer, lauds him to the skies. Dick accordingly receives an invitation to a lawn party to be given by Grace. Having been suspended for two weeks for some slight inattention to duty, he is at liberty to attend. On the day of the party, the Midland plans to run an important test train to clinch a big freight contract. Graves, business agent of a rival road, plans to delay the test train and thereby garner the contract. Graves, arriving early at the Cummings affair, calls one of his lieutenants aside and instructs him to see that the water tank near Lone Point is emptied. Grace overhears the plot and immediately 'phones to Helen just as she is about to be relieved, so that she too can come over to the lawn fete. In the meantime Dick, dressed in his afternoon togs, is impressed into service to run the test train, the regular engineer having been taken sick. Helen, ever loyal to her road, rushes off to the water tank after receiving Grace's message. There she is set upon by Graves' hirelings and made a prisoner on top of the tank. Dick brings his train under the spout to take on water and assists Helen to the ground. In their hurry to get away the crooks have left their auto on the nearby road. Using it to good advantage, Helen and Dick overtake a special on the rival line and by a ruse they persuade the engineer and firemen to climb out of the cab. Without further ado, Dick takes a crossover switch and is soon proceeding on his test run with a "borrowed" engine.",,"tt0419565",,,"movie"

An object lesson for those who spend their working hours in the safety of a modern office is given in thrilling pictures of the handling of dynamite. Then feats of strength are performed for the camera, including the bending of inch gas pipe. Food inspection by the Board of Health of New York follows, and illustrates the untiring efforts to keep the public foods clean and sanitary. Inspection of meat and condemnation of that which is unfit for use is of interest to all consumers. The selection and packing of oranges for market form an interesting strip.

The reel is divided into three sections. The first is Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica. The grotto in which as a lad Napoleon dreamed of the future is shown, as well as the monument which has been erected in memory of the great Emperor and his four brothers. The harbor, capable of welcoming the largest ships, is picturesque, as is the road begun in 312 B.C, a driveway lined with many beautiful tombs. With its narrow streets and dilapidated buildings, Ajaccio has a deserted appearance. Funchal, capital of the Madeira Islands, provides pictures for the second reel. With its whitewashed houses, Funchal presents an attractive appearance against a background of mountains 4,000 feet high. The streets are so steep and narrow that wheeled traffic is impossible. There are illuminating pictures of the natives, of Portuguese and Moorish descent. Undeniably beautiful is the scenery along the funicular railway which leads to the mountain top. The third section of this issue pictures Rostov-on-the-Don. This city is a seaport of southeastern Russia and in times of peace exports great quantities of grain. Fishing is another great industry. Among the interesting sights of the city are the bridge over the River Don, the cathedral of pure Russian type, the monument to Alexander II. the Liberator, and the statue of Catherine the Great. Another picture in this series shows preparations for the resumption of navigation with the thawing of the ice.",,"tt4258114",,,"movie"

The Gaumont Company has caught some of these for the screen in its picture called ""The Air." A goldfish swimming is a bowl is dropped into a liquid air bath and immediately removed so hard that it is broken with a hammer as if made of marble. The same process is repeated with the blossoms of flowering plants. Other experiments with air show how one can be asphyxiated with his own breath, how nitrogen is a dilutent of the oxygen in the air, and how a substance burns in pure oxygen. Another entertaining subject on the same reel visualizes the orange industry in California. There is a view of a 6,000-acre orange grove, and then follow pictures of the processes of picking and handling. It may come as a surprise to some that the oranges are given a bath and disinfected before they are sorted. The next picture is interesting for all who enjoy water sports. It is a series of views of a hydro-ski. This is apparently two baby canoes braced together, the occupant of the queer water craft standing with a foot in each as if in big shoes. In reality he is standing upon treadles which work a wheel placed between the two canoes at the stern. The contrivance is guided with a paddle. How apples are automatically graded for the market is a picture on this reel which shows the care taken in packing them according to size. The machine is complicated in mechanism, but the process is understood at a glance. On the same reel is a short picture in the series, "Things Not Generally Known." It shows how scattered glass is removed from the floor with wet absorbent cotton.",,"tt4239022",,,"movie"

Next comes a trip through the residence section of the city of New York, showing the homes of some of America's most famous sons, such as Charles Schwab, the steel baron ; Henry Frick, the steel magnate, and many others.

At the ranch, in the guise of a servant, is a Mexican called Pedro, who is the leader of a band of Mexican outlaws. He sees a chance to gain money by kidnapping Arthur and his daughter. He informs his band. Some days later, Neal and the cowboys go to the round-up, leaving Evelyn and her father at the camp. During their absence Pedro gives the signal to his gang. Meanwhile. Neal has fallen in love with the girl, but she refuses to listen to him. She realizes he could not give her any of the things to which she has been used. Neal is despondent. The outlaws take Evelyn and Arthur prisoners, and carry them to the Mexican camp. Neal and the boys return and find traces of the raid. They start on the trail and soon arrive in the Mexican camp, where Neal knocks the sentry on the head, and, exchanging clothes with him, sneaks into the camp alone. As he passes one of the huts, he hears a scream and, recognizing the girl's voice, enters and saves her from Pedro. He then hurries away with the two prisoners. Pedro rushes from the hut, calling his followers, but the cowboys begin to shoot, hitting him and causing the band to run for cover. Neal, Evelyn and Arthur ride away on their horses and the two visitors are soon on the train going east. The next morning at Lone Dog, Evelyn disappears from the train, and word is sent to Neal. He promptly sends the boys out in all directions to search for her, and starts across the country in the direction of the station where she was last seen. Later, he finds her on the desert and she tells him about leaving the train and buying a horse upon which she started back to the ranch. The horse ran away and she had been forced to struggle on as best she could. Neal is puzzled as to her reason for returning and she says, ""I was coming back to you. Isn't it a woman's privilege to change her mind?"",,"tt0328307",,,"movie"

Jabs, the newly appointed Chief of Police, puts his wife and two daughters into an auto and starts them off on a motoring tour. Before going Mrs. Jabs leaves her valuable pearl necklace with her husband for safe keeping. During the pool game, Billy Berlin, one of the members, rushes in with a copy of the daily paper and shows the members, including Pokes, the defy the new chief has published for the benefit of honest people and the downfall of the crooks. Pokes takes it as a joke, and discounts the ability of Jabs to do what he has promised. Pokes writes Jabs a note stating that he can get anything, any time, any place. Jabs goes at once to the club, where he meets Pokes. Producing the pearl necklace, Jabs wagers that he will place the necklace in a certain house, and defies Pokes to find it and bring it to the club. The necklace is placed, and Pokes starts out to get it. After thrilling experience and hair-breadth escapes Pokes is cornered in the cellar of the house by the chief and a squad of officers. They search him, but fail to find the necklace. Pokes, with a smile, leads the chief back to the club followed by the others. There Pokes takes off a wig, which no one knew he wore, produces the necklace, and claims the reward. But to Pokes' surprise the ""chief" removes a false mustache, and remarks calmly, "I am not Jabs." Pokes, nonplussed, tries to sneak away when Jabs appears from behind a chair, where he has watched the whole affair, and meets Pokes. The laugh is on Pokes, and while he stands there ashamed and thinking that honesty is the best policy, Jabs, with the necklace in his hand, gives him the laugh. A great metamorphosis takes place, which causes Jabs to remark, "Darwin was right."",,"tt4452292",,,"movie"

There is also a picture of the straits, as well as of the Spanish seaport of Algeciras, six miles west of Gibraltar. It was at Algeciras that there was a European conference to discuss the Agadir incident which Germany almost succeeded in making a cause for war several years before the great conflict. Typical scenes in the French protectorate of Tunis are also shown in this issue. These include street scenes, mosques, fountains, Arabian women, and "kif" smokers. Olives are raised in large quantities along the sea coast, and there is an opportunity to contrast these with those of California shown in Gaumont's "Reel Life" No. 35. The Bois de Boulogne is the largest park in Paris.

There are picturesque views of the Scottish Highlands, comprehensive pictures of Heidelberg, and a journey to the fashionable French watering place, and its nearby resort, Monte Carlo. The Scottish pictures were taken in County Cromarty, showing the rapids of the Druin, the cataracts of Kilmorack. the cascades of Invermoriston and the hills of Inverness. Cromarty is the northeastern part of Scotland, one of the wildest and most beautiful regions of the Highlands. There is an attractive picture of the Highland cattle, the famous animals with their characteristic long, rough hair and long horns. Heidelberg is seen in a panoramic view, and then the spectator is shown the old bridge across the Neckar, built in 1788. Most of this section of the reel is devoted to the castle which dates in part from the thirteenth century. It is now in ruins, part having been blown up in 1689, and part burned four years later when the French sacked the town. In 1864 fire destroyed most of what had either survived or been rebuilt. The beautiful gardens are shown with the buildings grouped about them. Mentone was purchased from Monaco by France in 1860. The most attractive picture, perhaps, is that of the pine-covered promontory which shelters the Bay of Mentone, crowned by a great hotel near the villa of ex-Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. The Monte Carlo scenes include pictures of the Casino, the famous gambling resort, the beautiful gardens, and the open-air café.",,"tt4239004",,,"movie"

She was shocked. Chagrined at her rebuff, he planned cunningly. On his way from her home, he sent a fake wire to Jim, purporting to come from his uncle, Frank Foster, and asking him to come at once, as he was dangerously ill. Jim, heeding the request, met Uncle Frank, who had just come to visit him. With Jim gone from the office, Dan had the office boy telephone to Nan, telling her that Jim wished her to come to the office. When she arrived, she found only Dan, who began forcing his attentions upon her. She struggled with him. Jim and Frank had gone home and the maid told of the message. Jim hurried back to the office to find his wife battling with Dan. Then it was that murder was done. Now he is hiding in a cabin, cheered by a note from Nan that she and Frank are working so that he can make his escape. A detective is put on the trail, and he locates Jim in the cabin through the dog which has been his companion. The detective straps Jim in a chair and then leaves to get a horse. The dog, having been shut out of the cabin, manages to dig his way into the house, and tugs at the strap which binds Jim until it snaps and Jim is free. When the detective returns Jim straps him into the chair and then taking a horse rides to the point where he meets Nan, and Foster.

At high tide the tiny place is an island. It is a towering pinnacle of granite topped by a Benedictine monastery which is an admirable example of military and monastic architecture as developed from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. The pictures give a general view of the islet, which is 165 feet high with a circumference of 3,000 feet. Various architectural features are dwelt upon, and there are special pictures of the Museum, the Cloister, Chapel St. Aubert and the Rocks and Tower of Gabriel. On the same reel are beautiful pictures contrasting the wild nomad life of Morocco and the result of civilization's softening influence as seen at Casablanca, the Atlantic seaport. Camp life is shown in the desert and at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. A military caravan is an interesting sight. The narrow-gauge military railway, as seen at Casablanca, is the first railway in Morocco. A third section is "Around Lake Iseo" in Northern Italy. This is a small but beautiful body of water at the foot of the Alps. Bordering Lake Iseo are Lovere, Predore and Capodi-Ponte. The scenery is typical of this part of Italy, and the villages are a picturesque mingling of the Swiss and Italian architecture.",,"tt4239002",,,"movie"

Carrying her tray of cigars and cigarettes, she knew nothing else, save honesty and a happy childish goodness. Among the crowd one stood out in Cigarette's eyes as being a hero, and this was Trot. Trot, being in a despondent mood, tells Cigarette that he has lost his position through resenting an insult passed about her. Pitying him, the Cigarette Girl brings him home to live with her mother. Money Meredith, a young millionaire, was a frequent visitor at the New York restaurant, and was particularly struck by Cigarette's honesty. Meredith through his boyish inclinations falls in the clutches of Mrs. Wilson, who with her husband is scheming to secure a large sum from Meredith. Meredith's lawyer hits on an idea, which is to have him marry and sign over his money to his wife, thereby forestalling any suit for alienation of affections. Attracted by the honesty of the Cigarette Girl, his lawyer advises Meredith to marry her for a month, and at the end of the period she is to receive $5,000. Consulting Trot and influenced by his advice, she accepts. Married, a new life begins. Meredith, always needing money, comes to Cigarette for a check, which he pleads is for Mrs. Wilson. Realizing that he is being defrauded, the Cigarette Girl refuses. Securing some money that Trot had made way with Cigarette returns it to Meredith and at his request signs over his money. Mrs. Wilson, being present, secures the papers and hurries away to cash a check of Meredith's, which she had previously obtained.",,"tt0168584",,,"movie"

Mr. Dale approves of his suit for his daughter's hand, but Julia's mother favors Don Wallace, who poses as a society man, but in reality is the leader of a notorious gang of thieves. Affiliated with Wallace is Olga Strogoff. Wallace plans to discredit Herbert. Wallace and Olga both attend the reception given at Dale's residence. Olga steals a watch from an old gentleman and drops it out of the window to the waiting gangster. Then she adroitly unclasps and removes from Julia's neck a pearl necklace. Herbert drops a card-case. Wallace picks it up, and, after enclosing the necklace taken from Julia, puts the card-case back in Herbert's pocket. The old gentleman discovers the loss of his watch and Julia the loss of her necklace. Mr. Dale telephones to the police station, and Detective Lamar responds. Wallace announces that he knows Herbert to be the thief, as he saw him put the necklace in his coat-pocket. The detective searches him and the necklace is found. The arrest of Herbert is stopped by Mr. Dale, who declares there must be some mistake. Wallace has apparently accomplished his purpose, as Julia will not recognize Herbert. But there is trouble in store for Wallace, as Olga betrays jealousy, and after trying to get him to desist in his attentions to Julia, she plans revenge. Olga overhears Wallace giving directions to rob the safe of the office where Herbert is employed. Detective Lamar accuses Herbert and arrests him. On the way to the police station, Olga informs the detective of Herbert's innocence. The den is raided and Herbert, the detective, and half a dozen policemen engage in a fight with gangsters, who are ultimately subdued and led off to the police station.

These places and the surrounding territory are rich in American history, for in this vicinity the cavaliers made their first settlements or the colony named in honor of England's queen. At Williamsburg are pictures of the old powder horn built in 1714, the court house, and Bruton Parish Church, the court church of colonial Virginia. The present building, erected in 1710, is claimed to be oldest Episcopal church in continuous use in America. There is a good picture of William and Mary college, founded in 1693, as well as of the Moore house, the dwelling on the James river in which were drawn the terms of surrender of Lord Cornwallis. There are also pictures of the spot nearby where the British surrendered Oct. 19, 1781, and the peace monument erected one hundred years later by congress to commemorate the event. At Hampton is pictured St. John's church, the oldest but one in America, where services have been held continuously since 1628. At Hampton Roads, the stretch of water where the battle between the Monitor and Merrimac was fought is shown, as well as the beautiful resort hotel at Old Point Comfort.

He leaves his wife, a brilliant young actress, and small son at home. During the early days of his introduction into the society of Rampart City, a typical mining town of the early 90's, Morrow made himself understood and respected by ""cleaning out" the gambling house run by "Single-Out" Wilmer and "Curley" Bud, Wilmer's partner, a performance that won for him the instant respect of "Bill" Joyce, a miner and "quick draw" exponent of the difference between right and wrong, who took Morrow into partnership. It was during the mêlée at Wilmer's gambling place that R. Alonzo Struthers, Sunday supplement photographer, representing a syndicate of American newspapers, snapped the troublous scene, with Morrow and "Bill" Joyce celebrating the victory of the former, and incidentally made pictures of subsequent scenes in which a score or more of miners and dance hall women were displayed drinking at tables, dancing and generally carousing. Struthers, impressed with the splendid action of the photographs that resulted from his flashlight activities, showed them to Morrow, who recognized that Struthers had staged the more picturesque of the dance hall scenes, participating in them himself and permitting another man to operate the flash. Morrow pointed out to Struthers that his wife would be sure to see the pictures if they were printed in the United States papers and forbade him to use them, thus letting the photographer into an understanding of the fact that Morrow was well connected and that his wife might "start something" if she recognized him as being involved in a gambling house row. After Struthers' departure by the outgoing boat and the long mail delay of arctic weather, Morrow was struck speechless one day to receive notice of suit for divorce filed by his wife in San Francisco. It did not take Morrow long to start for the States, accompanied, of course, by his partner, "Bill" Joyce. Nor did it take long, once the young miner arrived in San Francisco, to discover that Struthers had sent broadcast, for Sunday publication, pictures taken by him in the gambling house, but that worst of all, he had substituted the head of Justus Morrow on the dance hall pictures of himself, taken in various familiar poses with dance hall women. Without definite knowledge as to where he might find his wife. Morrow accidentally discovered her and the son, singing in a vaudeville house in San Francisco, but was refused an interview by the indignant woman, who believed that the camera could not lie. In this crisis "Bill" Joyce proved equal to the occasion. He invaded the apartments of Mrs. Morrow by a ruse, demanded an explanation on behalf of his partner, threatened to kill half the police of San Francisco if she didn't listen to him quietly, sought and found Struthers and dragged him to the family confessional with a gun muzzle in his ear, in short, brought Mrs. Morrow to a realization of the folly of hasty judgments and left "pardner" with his wife in his arms and "the kid" squeezed up a delighted little bundle between them.",,"tt0161905",,,"movie"

There has been a mysterious succession of pearl robberies in society circles. M. Bouet is an expert judge of pearls and offers to aid in an endeavor to detect the thief. As time passes, Constance finds that she is unable to meet the payments on the pearl necklace, and she writes to Mandeville to come to her home and get the necklace. When she searches for the pearls, however, she finds them gone. Then she remembers that Bouet had visited her home that afternoon, and she suspects him as being the thief. She rushes to the man's studio and a few minutes later her husband returns from his business trip, and discovers the string of pearls on the ground. Armitage discovers his wife and the artist together and denounces them. As he returns home, he meets Mandeville, who explains matters and shows him Constance's letter.

The manner in which the hounds are put on the trail, how they follow it, and how they act upon catching up with the fleeing man makes this an interesting subject. Hounds from this pack have successfully trailed a man eighty miles. The reel ends with a short "Dance of the Rainbow," a pretty and aesthetic terpsichorean number.",,"tt4239030",,,"movie"

Anson is accepted at once, but John is rejected on account of his arm. Anson is lauded as a hero by the neighbors and Ethel is impressed by his prowess in volunteering. She does not know that John has been rejected for physical reasons. Anson is called at once, and has no time to visit Ethel. He writes her a letter in which he says good-by and mentions the fact that John will not be with him in the regiment. Ethel then thinks that John has shown the white feather, and when he calls to see her, she denies herself to him. He is much hurt but accepts her decision. He tries in every way to get to the front, and at last succeeds in being sent as a war correspondent. One day his heroism is instrumental in saving the Union Army from defeat. In writing the story for his paper, he gives the credit for his brave deed to Anson, for Ethel's sake, so that she may be proud of her lover. After the return of the regiment, at the end of the war, Anson is received as a hero by his town. Ethel worships his courage, and is engaged to him.
