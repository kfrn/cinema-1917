Want JSON-encoded data on films? You won't get it from the [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com), and third-party solutions like the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) provide limited search capabilities.  

Enter the **Cinema 1917 API**, which houses a large film dataset and provides a range of ways to query these data. As the name suggests, **Cinema 1917** contains data about all 5000+ films released in 1917.

* Read about how to use the API [here]('./documentation.md')
* Access the API itself [here](http://cinema-1917-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/random).

**_Disclaimer_**: no guarantees are made as to the accuracy of the data. The database was populated via use of the OMDb API, and is assumed to derive from IMDb's film data.
